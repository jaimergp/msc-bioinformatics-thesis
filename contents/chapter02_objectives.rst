The current state of the art in molecular design software shows that available programs are very good at handling certain search spaces, but cannot face the complexities that arise from combining some of them. 
In response to the demands of the chemobiological design community, the present Master thesis consists of a new tool was designed to help addressing these issues and of two initial tests on its capabilities. 

As a result, the concrete objectives of this dissertation are: 

- Designing a multi-objective genetic optimization engine that can face exploring a huge multidimensional space (chapter 3).
- Implement a lightweight GUI viewer that can help examine thousands of chemically and physically sound solutions (chapter 3).
- Initiate a computationally based design of an artificial hemocyanin by proposing several candidate structures (chapter 4).
- Apply inverse molecular design by optimizing the coordination sphere of an aluminium centre in a series of possible protein binders (chapter 5).
