However, during the implementation process of our approach, we realised that it was versatile enough to deal with other kind of experiments, too. We could not resist and tried to apply our gained savoir-faire to an additional essay. As a result, chapter 05 shows the extensibility of GAUDI in action by performing a refinement essay of a GRID-minimized experiment. This former case study demonstrates that GAUDI can work just fine with both top-down and bottom-up approaches.
