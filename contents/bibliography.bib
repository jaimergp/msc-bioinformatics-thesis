abstract = {The crystal structure of Limulus polyphemus subunit type II hemocyanin in the deoxygenated state has been determined to a resolution of 2.18 A. Phase information for this first structure of a cheliceratan hemocyanin was obtained by molecular replacement using the crustacean hemocyanin structure of Panulirus interruptus. The most striking observation in the Limulus structure is the unexpectedly large distance of 4.6 A between both copper ions in the oxygen-binding site. Each copper has approximate trigonal planar coordination by three histidine N epsilon atoms. No bridging ligand between the copper ions could be detected. Other important new discoveries are (1) the presence of a cis-peptide bond between Glu 309 and Ser 310, with the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide plane hydrogen bonded to the N delta atom of the copper B ligand His 324; (2) localization of a chloride-binding site in the interface between the first and second domain; (3) localization of a putative calcium-binding site in the third domain. Furthermore, comparison of Limulus versus Panulirus hemocyanin revealed considerable tertiary and quaternary rigid body movements, although the overall folds are similar. Within the subunit, the first domain is rotated by about 7.5 degrees with respect to the other two domains, whereas within the hexamer the major movement is a 3.1 degrees rotation of the trimers with respect to each other. The rigid body rotation of the first domain suggests a structural mechanism for the allosteric regulation by chloride ions and probably causes the cooperative transition of the hexamer between low and high oxygen affinity states. In this postulated mechanism, the fully conserved Phe49 is the key residue that couples conformational changes of the dinuclear copper site into movements of the first domain.},

@article{Wang2002,
abstract = {We have developed a fast procedure to predict solvation free energies for both organic and biological molecules. This solvation model is based on weighted solvent accessible surface area (WSAS). Least-squares fittings have been applied to optimize the weights of SAS for different atom types in order to reproduce the experimental solvation free energies. Good agreement with experimental results has been obtained. For the 184-molecule set (model I), for which there are experimental solvation free energies in 1-octanol, we have achieved an average error of 0.36 kcal/mol, better than that of the SM5.42R universal solvation model1 by Li et al. For the 245-molecule set (model II) that has experimental aqueous solvation free energies, our WSAS model achieves an average error of 0.48 kcal/mol, marginally larger than that of Li's model (0.46 kcal/mol). We have used a 401-molecule set, the largest training set (model IV) that we know of solvation model development, to derive the SAS weights in order to reproduce the experimental solvation free energies in water. For this model, we have achieved an average unsigned error of 0.54 kcal/mol and an RMS error of 0.79 kcal/mol.The advantage of this model lies in its simplicity and independence of charge models. We have successfully applied this model to predict the relative binding free energies for the five binding modes of HIV-1RT/efavirenz. The most favorable binding mode, which has an RMSD of 1.1 \&Aring; (for 54 C around the binding site) compared to the crystal structure, has a binding free energy at least 10 kcal/mol more negative than the other binding modes. Moreover, the solvation free energies with WSAS have a high correlation (the correlation coefficient is 0.92) to the solvation free energies calculated by the Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (PBSA) model. As an efficient and fast approach, WASA is also attractive for protein modeling and protein folding studies. We have applied this model to predict the solvation free energies of the 36-mer villin headpiece subdomain in its native structure, a compact folding intermediate, and a random coil. The rank order of the solvation free energies and the free energies for the three kinds of conformational clusters are in reasonable agreement with those found by MM-PBSA, a widely used solvation free energy model.},

abstract = {We have recently completed systematic molecular dynamics simulations of 807 different proteins representing 95\% of the known autonomous protein folds in an effort we refer to as Dynameomics. Here we focus on the analysis of side chain conformations and dynamics to create a dynamic rotamer library. Overall this library is derived from 31,000 occurrences of each of 86,217 different residues, or 2.7 × 10(9) rotamers. This dynamic library has 74\% overlap of rotamer distributions with rotamer libraries derived from static high-resolution crystal structures. Seventy-five percent of the residues had an assignable primary conformation, and 68\% of the residues had at least one significant alternate conformation. The average correlation time for switching between rotamers ranged from 22 ps for Met to over 8 ns for Cys; this time decreased 20-fold on the surface of the protein and modestly for dihedral angles further from the main chain. Side chain S(2) axis order parameters were calculated and they correlated well with those derived from NMR relaxation experiments (R = 0.9). Relationships relating the S(2) axis order parameters to rotamer occupancy were derived. Overall the Dynameomics rotamer library offers a comprehensive depiction of side chain rotamer preferences and dynamics in solution, and more realistic distributions for dynamic proteins in solution at ambient temperature than libraries derived from crystal structures, in particular charged surface residues are better represented. Details of the rotamer library are presented here and the library itself can be downloaded at http://www.dynameomics.org.},

Previous crystal surveys have generated 1D frequency distributions of hydrogen-bond distances and angles, which are not sufficient to model the hydrogen bond as a ligand-receptor interaction. For each hydrogen-bonding group of interest to the drug designer, geometric hydrogen-bond criteria have been derived. The 3D distribution of complementary atoms about each hydrogen-bonding group has been ascertained by dividing the space about each group into bins of equal volume and counting the number of observed hydrogen-bonding contacts in each bin. Finally, the propensity of each group to form a hydrogen bond has been calculated. Together, these data can be used to predict the potential site points with which a ligand could interact and therefore could be used in molecular-similarity studies, pharmacophore query searching of databases, or de novo design algorithms.},

abstract = {The estimation of free energy of binding is a key problem in structure-based design. We developed the scoring function HYDE based on a consistent description of HYdrogen bond and DEhydration energies in protein-ligand complexes. HYDE is applicable to all types of protein targets since it is not calibrated on experimental binding affinity data or protein-ligand complexes. The comprehensible atom-based score of HYDE is visualized by applying a very intuitive coloring scheme, thereby facilitating the analysis of protein-ligand complexes in the lead optimization process. In this paper, we have revised several aspects of the former version of HYDE which was described in detail previously. The revised HYDE version was already validated in large-scale redocking and screening experiments which were performed in the course of the Docking and Scoring Symposium at 241st ACS National Meeting. In this study, we additionally evaluate the ability of the revised HYDE version to predict binding affinities. On the PDBbind 2007 coreset, HYDE achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.62 between the experimental binding constants and the predicted binding energy, performing second best on this dataset compared to 17 other well-established scoring functions. Further, we show that the performance of HYDE in large-scale redocking and virtual screening experiments on the Astex diverse set and the DUD dataset respectively, is comparable to the best methods in this field.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We determined the antitumor properties of a newly available hemocyanin obtained from the Chilean gastropod Concholepas concholepas (Biosonda Corp., Santiago, Chile) in a syngeneic heterotopic mouse bladder carcinoma model. Since keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois) is used increasingly in biomedicine as a carrier for vaccines and an immunotherapeutic agent for bladder transitional cell carcinoma, there is a growing interest in finding new substances that share its potent immunomodulatory properties. Considering that keyhole limpet hemocyanin and Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin differ significantly, it was not possible to predict a priori the antitumor properties of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: C3H/He mice were primed with Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin before subcutaneous implantation of mouse bladder tumor-2 cells. Treatment consisted of a subcutaneous dose of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin (1 mg or 100 mug) at different intervals after implantation. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin and phosphate buffered saline served as positive and negative controls, respectively. In addition, experiments were designed to determine which elements of the immune response were involved in its adjuvant immunostimulatory effect.

RESULTS: Mice treated with Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin showed a significant antitumor effect, as demonstrated by decreased tumor growth and incidence, prolonged survival and lack of toxic effects. These effects were similar to those achieved with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. We found that each hemocyanin increased natural killer cell activity but the effect of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin was stronger. Analysis of serum from treated mice showed an increased interferon-gamma and low interleukin-4, which correlated with antibody isotypes, confirming that hemocyanins induce a T helper type 1 cytokine profile.

CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge our results are the first demonstration of the antitumor effect of a hemocyanin other than keyhole limpet hemocyanin. They suggest that this is an ancient conserved immunogenic mechanism shared by those hemocyanins that is able to enhance T helper type 1 immunity and lead to antitumor activity. Therefore, Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin may be an alternative candidate for providing safe and effective immunotherapy for human superficial bladder cancer.},

abstract = {The HYDE scoring function consistently describes hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic effect and desolvation. It relies on HYdration and DEsolvation terms which are calibrated using octanol/water partition coefficients of small molecules. We do not use affinity data for calibration, therefore HYDE is generally applicable to all protein targets. HYDE reflects the Gibbs free energy of binding while only considering the essential interactions of protein-ligand complexes. The greatest benefit of HYDE is that it yields a very intuitive atom-based score, which can be mapped onto the ligand and protein atoms. This allows the direct visualization of the score and consequently facilitates analysis of protein-ligand complexes during the lead optimization process. In this study, we validated our new scoring function by applying it in large-scale docking experiments. We could successfully predict the correct binding mode in 93\% of complexes in redocking calculations on the Astex diverse set, while our performance in virtual screening experiments using the DUD dataset showed significant enrichment values with a mean AUC of 0.77 across all protein targets with little or no structural defects. As part of these studies, we also carried out a very detailed analysis of the data that revealed interesting pitfalls, which we highlight here and which should be addressed in future benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {The hypervolume measure (or S metric) is a frequently applied quality measure for comparing the results of evolutionary multiobjective optimisation algorithms (EMOA). The new idea is to aim explicitly for the maximisation of the dominated hypervolume within the optimisation process. A steady-state EMOA is proposed that features a selection operator based on the hypervolume measure combined with the concept of non-dominated sorting. The algorithm’s population evolves to a well-distributed set of solutions, thereby focussing on interesting regions of the Pareto front. The performance of the devised S metric selection EMOA (SMS-EMOA) is compared to state-of-the-art methods on two- and three-objective benchmark suites as well as on aeronautical real-world applications.},

@article{Sanner1996,
abstract = {Because of their wide use in molecular modeling, methods to compute molecular surfaces have received a lot of interest in recent years. However, most of the proposed algorithms compute the analytical representation of only the solvent-accessible surface. There are a few programs that compute the analytical representation of the solvent-excluded surface, but they often have problems handling singular cases of self-intersecting surfaces and tend to fail on large molecules (more than 10,000 atoms). We describe here a program called MSMS, which is shown to be fast and reliable in computing molecular surfaces. It relies on the use of the reduced surface that is briefly defined here and from which the solvent-accessible and solvent-excluded surfaces are computed. The four algorithms composing MSMS are described and their complexity is analyzed. Special attention is given to the handling of self-intersecting parts of the solvent-excluded surface called singularities. The program has been compared with Connolly's program PQMS [M.L. Connolly (1993) Journal of Molecular Graphics, Vol. 11, pp. 139-141] on a set of 709 molecules taken from the Brookhaven Data Base. MSMS was able to compute topologically correct surfaces for each molecule in the set. Moreover, the actual time spent to compute surfaces is in agreement with the theoretical complexity of the program, which is shown to be O[n log(n)] for n atoms. On a Hewlett-Packard 9000/735 workstation, MSMS takes 0.73 s to produce a triangulated solvent-excluded surface for crambin (1 crn, 46 residues, 327 atoms, 4772 triangles), 4.6 s for thermolysin (3tln, 316 residues, 2437 atoms, 26462 triangles), and 104.53 s for glutamine synthetase (2gls, 5676 residues, 43632 atoms, 476665 triangles).},

@article{Axenopoulos2014,
abstract = {Protein functions are carried out through their interactions with other biological molecules. Research in protein interactions has attracted special interest from the scientific community for decades and still remains a hot research topic. Among others, there is an increasing interest to develop computational methods that automatically predict the 3D structure of protein-protein complexes, such as protein-protein docking. In this thesis, we propose novel approaches to assist protein-protein docking and protein similarity search. The proposed methods are based on the fact that when two proteins interact, their surfaces at the binding site demonstrate geometric complementarity (apart from physicochemical complementarity). The first docking method is based on geometric complementarity matching of the molecular surfaces. The basic idea of this algorithm is to use a descriptor that measures 3D shape similarity for computing shape complementarity, since equally-sized complementary surface patches tend to have similar shapes. A basic property of the proposed shape descriptor is its invariance to rotations of the surface patches. Complementarity matching is achieved through pairwise comparison of the local shape descriptors, thus, providing a fast geometric filtering and avoiding the exhaustive translational and rotational search of existing docking techniques.The second docking method extends this work in order to produce a docking algorithm that is robust to relatively small conformational changes of the interacting proteins. Since accurate surface complementarity has been proven to be inappropriate in unbound docking, the new method allows binding of surfaces with approximate surface complementarity. Experiments proved that the improved algorithm is more robust to conformational changes. Furthermore, a new scoring function is presented, which combines geometric complementarity with physicochemical factors, such as Coulomb potentials, van der Waals forces, hydrophobicity. The scoring function takes as input the list of candidate poses and a new rank list is produced having more near-native poses in the first positions. The last method that is proposed in this dissertation is an approach for molecular shape comparison. It aims to assist the problem of virtual screening, a process that is commonly used in rational drug design. More specifically, a new shape descriptor is proposed that combines local, global and hybrid local-global shape features. It is experimentally proven that the proposed compound descriptor is appropriate for similarity search of flexible ligands, while at the same time is robust in shape comparison of rigid proteins. Due to its compactness, the new descriptor enables fast screening of similar ligands to a target molecule from very large compound databases.\%\%\%\%Ο$\iota$ $\lambda$$\epsilon$$\iota$$\tau$ο$\upsilon$$\rho$$\gamma$ί$\epsilon$ς $\tau$$\omega$$\nu$ $\pi$$\rho$$\omega$$\tau$$\epsilon$ϊ$\nu$ώ$\nu$ $\pi$$\rho$$\alpha$$\gamma$$\mu$$\alpha$$\tau$ο$\pi$ο$\iota$ού$\nu$$\tau$$\alpha$$\iota$ $\kappa$$\upsilon$$\rho$ί$\omega$ς $\mu$έ$\sigma$$\omega$ $\tau$$\omega$$\nu$ $\alpha$$\lambda$$\lambda$$\eta$$\lambda$$\epsilon$$\pi$$\iota$$\delta$$\rho$ά$\sigma$$\epsilon$ώ$\nu$ $\tau$ο$\upsilon$ς $\mu$$\epsilon$ ά$\lambda$$\lambda$$\alpha$ $\mu$ό$\rho$$\iota$$\alpha$.

@article{Eyal2004a,
abstract = {Contact surface area and chemical properties of atoms are used to concurrently predict conformations of multiple amino acid side chains on a fixed protein backbone. The combination of surface complementarity and solvent-accessible surface accounts for van der Waals forces and solvation free energy. The scoring function is particularly suitable for modeling partially buried side chains. Both iterative and stochastic searching approaches are used. Our programs (Sccomp-I and Sccomp-S), with relatively fast execution times, correctly predict chi1 angles for 92-93\% of buried residues and 82-84\% for all residues, with an RMSD of approximately 1.7 A for side chain heavy atoms. We find that the differential between the atomic solvation parameters and the contact surface parameters (including those between noncomplementary atoms) is positive; i.e., most protein atoms prefer surface contact with other protein atoms rather than with the solvent. This might correspond to the driving force for maximizing packing of the protein. The influence of the crystal packing, completeness of rotamer library and precise positioning of Cbeta atoms on the accuracy of side-chain prediction are examined. The Sccomp-S and Sccomp-I programs can be accessed through the Web (http://sgedg.weizmann.ac.il/sccomp.html) and are available for several platforms.},

@article{Reulecke2008,
abstract = {We developed a new empirical scoring function, HYDE, for the evaluation of protein-ligand complexes. HYDE estimates binding free energy based on two terms for dehydration and hydrogen bonding only. The essential feature of this scoring function is the integrated use of log P-derived atomic increments for the prediction of free dehydration energy and hydrogen bonding energy. Taking the dehydration of atoms within the interface into account shows that some atoms contribute favorably to the overall score, while others contribute unfavorably. For instance, hydrogen bond functions are penalized if they are dehydrated unless they can overcompensate this loss by forming a hydrogen bond with excellent geometry. The main stabilizing contribution represents the removal of apolar groups from the water: the hydrophobic effect. Initial studies using the DUD dataset show that with HYDE, there is a significant decrease in false positives, a reasonable categorization of compounds as either non-binders, weak, medium or strong binders, and in particular, there is a generally applicable and thermodynamically sensible cutoff score below which there is a high likelihood that the compound is indeed a binder.},
