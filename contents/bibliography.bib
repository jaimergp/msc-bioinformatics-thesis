abstract = {The Aluminum Hypothesis, the idea that aluminum exposure is involved in the etiology of Alzheimer disease, dates back to a 1965 demonstration that aluminum causes neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of rabbits. Initially the focus of intensive research, the Aluminum Hypothesis has gradually been abandoned by most researchers. Yet, despite this current indifference, the Aluminum Hypothesis continues to attract the attention of a small group of scientists and aluminum continues to be viewed with concern by some of the public. This review article discusses reasons that mainstream science has largely abandoned the Aluminum Hypothesis and explores a possible reason for some in the general public continuing to view aluminum with mistrust.},

abstract = {Since the early 1990s, several technological and scientific advances - such as combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening and the sequencing of the human genome - have been heralded as remedies to the problems facing the pharmaceutical industry. The use of these technologies in some form is now well established at most pharmaceutical companies; however, the return on investment in terms of marketed products has not met expectations. Fragment-based drug design is another tool for drug discovery that has emerged in the past decade. Here, we describe the development and evolution of fragment-based drug design, analyse the role that this approach can have in combination with other discovery technologies and highlight the impact that fragment-based methods have made in progressing new medicines into the clinic.},

@article{Santibanez2007,
abstract = {Epidemiological evidence of an association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the most frequently studied occupational exposures--pesticides, solvents, electromagnetic fields (EMF), lead and aluminium--is inconsistent. Epidemiological studies published up to June of 2003 were systematically searched through PubMed and Toxline. Twenty-four studies (21 case-control and 3 cohort studies) were included. Median GQI was 36.6\% (range 19.5-62.9\%). Most of the case-control studies had a GQI of <50\%. The study with the highest score was a cohort study. Likelihood of exposure misclassification bias affected 18 of the 24 studies. Opportunity for bias arising from the use of surrogate informants affected 17 studies, followed by disease misclassification (11 studies) and selection bias (10 studies). Eleven studies explored the relationship of AD with solvents, seven with EMF, six with pesticides, six with lead and three with aluminium. For pesticides, studies of greater quality and prospective design found increased and statistically significant associations. For the remaining occupational agents, the evidence of association is less consistent (for solvents and EMF) or absent (for lead and aluminium).},

@article{Hoffer2013,
abstract = {This paper describes the use and validation of S4MPLE in Fragment-Based Drug Design (FBDD)--a strategy to build drug-like ligands starting from small compounds called fragments. S4MPLE is a conformational sampling tool based on a hybrid genetic algorithm that is able to simulate one (conformer enumeration) or more molecules (docking). The goal of the current paper is to show that due to the judicious design of genetic operators, S4MPLE may be used without any specific adaptation as an in silico FBDD tool. Such fragment-to-lead evolution involves either growing of one or linking of several fragment-like binder(s). The native ability to specifically "dock" a substructure that is covalently anchored to its target (here, some prepositioned fragment formally part of the binding site) enables it to act like dedicated de novo builders and differentiates it from most classical docking tools, which may only cope with non-covalent interactions. Besides, S4MPLE may address growing/linking scenarios involving protein site flexibility, and it might also suggest "growth" moves by bridging the ligand to the site via water-mediated interactions if H2O molecules are simply appended to the input files. Therefore, the only development overhead required to build a virtual fragment→ligand growing/linking strategy based on S4MPLE were two chemoinformatics programs meant to provide a minimalistic management of the linker library. The first creates a duplicate-free library by fragmenting a compound database, whereas the second builds new compounds, attaching chemically compatible linkers to the starting fragments. S4MPLE is subsequently used to probe the optimal placement of the linkers within the binding site, with initial restraints on atoms from initial fragments, followed by an optimization of all kept poses after restraint removal. Ranking is mainly based on two criteria: force-field potential energy and RMSD shifts of the original fragment moieties. This strategy was applied to several examples from the FBDD literature with good results over several monitored criteria: ability to generate the optimized ligand (or close analogs), good ranking of analogs among decoy compounds, and accurate predictions of expected binding modes of reference ligands. Simulations included "classical" covalent growing/linking, more challenging ones involving binding site conformational changes, and growth with optional recognition of putatively favorable water-mediated interactions.},

@article{Sanner1996,
abstract = {Because of their wide use in molecular modeling, methods to compute molecular surfaces have received a lot of interest in recent years. However, most of the proposed algorithms compute the analytical representation of only the solvent-accessible surface. There are a few programs that compute the analytical representation of the solvent-excluded surface, but they often have problems handling singular cases of self-intersecting surfaces and tend to fail on large molecules (more than 10,000 atoms). We describe here a program called MSMS, which is shown to be fast and reliable in computing molecular surfaces. It relies on the use of the reduced surface that is briefly defined here and from which the solvent-accessible and solvent-excluded surfaces are computed. The four algorithms composing MSMS are described and their complexity is analyzed. Special attention is given to the handling of self-intersecting parts of the solvent-excluded surface called singularities. The program has been compared with Connolly's program PQMS [M.L. Connolly (1993) Journal of Molecular Graphics, Vol. 11, pp. 139-141] on a set of 709 molecules taken from the Brookhaven Data Base. MSMS was able to compute topologically correct surfaces for each molecule in the set. Moreover, the actual time spent to compute surfaces is in agreement with the theoretical complexity of the program, which is shown to be O[n log(n)] for n atoms. On a Hewlett-Packard 9000/735 workstation, MSMS takes 0.73 s to produce a triangulated solvent-excluded surface for crambin (1 crn, 46 residues, 327 atoms, 4772 triangles), 4.6 s for thermolysin (3tln, 316 residues, 2437 atoms, 26462 triangles), and 104.53 s for glutamine synthetase (2gls, 5676 residues, 43632 atoms, 476665 triangles).},

abstract = {Essential for viral replication and highly conserved among poxviridae, the vaccinia virus I7L ubiquitin-like proteinase (ULP) is an attractive target for development of smallpox antiviral drugs. At the same time, the I7L proteinase exemplifies several interesting challenges from the rational drug design perspective. In the absence of a published I7L X-ray structure, we have built a detailed 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site (S2-S2' pocket) based on exceptionally high structural conservation of this site in proteases of the ULP family. The accuracy and limitations of this model were assessed through comparative analysis of available X-ray structures of ULPs, as well as energy based conformational modeling. The 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site was used to perform covalent docking and VLS of a comprehensive library of about 230,000 available ketone and aldehyde compounds. Out of 456 predicted ligands, 97 inhibitors of I7L proteinase activity were confirmed in biochemical assays ( approximately 20\% overall hit rate). These experimental results both validate our I7L ligand binding model and provide initial leads for rational optimization of poxvirus I7L proteinase inhibitors. Thus, fragments predicted to bind in the prime portion of the active site can be combined with fragments on non-prime side to yield compounds with improved activity and specificity.},

@article{Huggins2009,
abstract = {Computational molecular design is a useful tool in modern drug discovery. Virtual screening is an approach that docks and then scores individual members of compound libraries. In contrast to this forward approach, inverse approaches construct compounds from fragments, such that the computed affinity, or a combination of relevant properties, is optimized. We have recently developed a new inverse approach to drug design based on the dead-end elimination and A* algorithms employing a physical potential function. This approach has been applied to combinatorially constructed libraries of small-molecule ligands to design high-affinity HIV-1 protease inhibitors (Altman et al., J Am Chem Soc 2008;130:6099-6013). Here we have evaluated the new method using the well-studied W191G mutant of cytochrome c peroxidase. This mutant possesses a charged binding pocket and has been used to evaluate other design approaches. The results show that overall the new inverse approach does an excellent job of separating binders from nonbinders. For a few individual cases, scoring inaccuracies led to false positives. The majority of these involve erroneous solvation energy estimation for charged amines, anilinium ions, and phenols, which has been observed previously for a variety of scoring algorithms. Interestingly, although inverse approaches are generally expected to identify some but not all binders in a library, due to limited conformational searching, these results show excellent coverage of the known binders while still showing strong discrimination of the nonbinders.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of Limulus polyphemus subunit type II hemocyanin in the deoxygenated state has been determined to a resolution of 2.18 A. Phase information for this first structure of a cheliceratan hemocyanin was obtained by molecular replacement using the crustacean hemocyanin structure of Panulirus interruptus. The most striking observation in the Limulus structure is the unexpectedly large distance of 4.6 A between both copper ions in the oxygen-binding site. Each copper has approximate trigonal planar coordination by three histidine N epsilon atoms. No bridging ligand between the copper ions could be detected. Other important new discoveries are (1) the presence of a cis-peptide bond between Glu 309 and Ser 310, with the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide plane hydrogen bonded to the N delta atom of the copper B ligand His 324; (2) localization of a chloride-binding site in the interface between the first and second domain; (3) localization of a putative calcium-binding site in the third domain. Furthermore, comparison of Limulus versus Panulirus hemocyanin revealed considerable tertiary and quaternary rigid body movements, although the overall folds are similar. Within the subunit, the first domain is rotated by about 7.5 degrees with respect to the other two domains, whereas within the hexamer the major movement is a 3.1 degrees rotation of the trimers with respect to each other. The rigid body rotation of the first domain suggests a structural mechanism for the allosteric regulation by chloride ions and probably causes the cooperative transition of the hexamer between low and high oxygen affinity states. In this postulated mechanism, the fully conserved Phe49 is the key residue that couples conformational changes of the dinuclear copper site into movements of the first domain.},

@article{Axenopoulos2014,
abstract = {Protein functions are carried out through their interactions with other biological molecules. Research in protein interactions has attracted special interest from the scientific community for decades and still remains a hot research topic. Among others, there is an increasing interest to develop computational methods that automatically predict the 3D structure of protein-protein complexes, such as protein-protein docking. In this thesis, we propose novel approaches to assist protein-protein docking and protein similarity search. The proposed methods are based on the fact that when two proteins interact, their surfaces at the binding site demonstrate geometric complementarity (apart from physicochemical complementarity). The first docking method is based on geometric complementarity matching of the molecular surfaces. The basic idea of this algorithm is to use a descriptor that measures 3D shape similarity for computing shape complementarity, since equally-sized complementary surface patches tend to have similar shapes. A basic property of the proposed shape descriptor is its invariance to rotations of the surface patches. Complementarity matching is achieved through pairwise comparison of the local shape descriptors, thus, providing a fast geometric filtering and avoiding the exhaustive translational and rotational search of existing docking techniques.The second docking method extends this work in order to produce a docking algorithm that is robust to relatively small conformational changes of the interacting proteins. Since accurate surface complementarity has been proven to be inappropriate in unbound docking, the new method allows binding of surfaces with approximate surface complementarity. Experiments proved that the improved algorithm is more robust to conformational changes. Furthermore, a new scoring function is presented, which combines geometric complementarity with physicochemical factors, such as Coulomb potentials, van der Waals forces, hydrophobicity. The scoring function takes as input the list of candidate poses and a new rank list is produced having more near-native poses in the first positions. The last method that is proposed in this dissertation is an approach for molecular shape comparison. It aims to assist the problem of virtual screening, a process that is commonly used in rational drug design. More specifically, a new shape descriptor is proposed that combines local, global and hybrid local-global shape features.

abstract = {An extensive crystal survey of the Cambridge Structural Database has been carried out to provide hydrogen-bond data for use in drug-design strategies. Previous crystal surveys have generated 1D frequency distributions of hydrogen-bond distances and angles, which are not sufficient to model the hydrogen bond as a ligand-receptor interaction. For each hydrogen-bonding group of interest to the drug designer, geometric hydrogen-bond criteria have been derived. The 3D distribution of complementary atoms about each hydrogen-bonding group has been ascertained by dividing the space about each group into bins of equal volume and counting the number of observed hydrogen-bonding contacts in each bin. Finally, the propensity of each group to form a hydrogen bond has been calculated. Together, these data can be used to predict the potential site points with which a ligand could interact and therefore could be used in molecular-similarity studies, pharmacophore query searching of databases, or de novo design algorithms.},

A steady-state EMOA is proposed that features a selection operator based on the hypervolume measure combined with the concept of non-dominated sorting. The algorithm’s population evolves to a well-distributed set of solutions, thereby focussing on interesting regions of the Pareto front.

Interestingly, while protein-ligand dockings have long become a spearhead in computer assisted drug design, no benchmarking nor optimization have been done for their use with organometallic compounds. Pursuing our efforts to model metal mediated recognition processes, we herein present a systematic study of the capabilities of the program GOLD to predict the interactions of protein with organometallic compounds. The study focuses on inert systems for which no alteration of the first coordination sphere of the metal occurs upon binding. Several scaffolds are used as test systems with different docking schemes and scoring functions. We conclude that ChemScore is the most robust scoring function with ASP and ChemPLP providing with good results too and GoldScore slightly underperforming. This study shows that current state-of-the-art protein-ligand docking techniques are reliable for the docking of inert organometallic compounds binding to protein.},

abstract = {We have recently completed systematic molecular dynamics simulations of 807 different proteins representing 95\% of the known autonomous protein folds in an effort we refer to as Dynameomics. Here we focus on the analysis of side chain conformations and dynamics to create a dynamic rotamer library. Overall this library is derived from 31,000 occurrences of each of 86,217 different residues, or 2.7 × 10(9) rotamers. This dynamic library has 74\% overlap of rotamer distributions with rotamer libraries derived from static high-resolution crystal structures. Seventy-five percent of the residues had an assignable primary conformation, and 68\% of the residues had at least one significant alternate conformation. The average correlation time for switching between rotamers ranged from 22 ps for Met to over 8 ns for Cys; this time decreased 20-fold on the surface of the protein and modestly for dihedral angles further from the main chain. Side chain S(2) axis order parameters were calculated and they correlated well with those derived from NMR relaxation experiments (R = 0.9). Relationships relating the S(2) axis order parameters to rotamer occupancy were derived. Overall the Dynameomics rotamer library offers a comprehensive depiction of side chain rotamer preferences and dynamics in solution, and more realistic distributions for dynamic proteins in solution at ambient temperature than libraries derived from crystal structures, in particular charged surface residues are better represented. Details of the rotamer library are presented here and the library itself can be downloaded at http://www.dynameomics.org.},

abstract = {Contact surface area and chemical properties of atoms are used to concurrently predict conformations of multiple amino acid side chains on a fixed protein backbone. The combination of surface complementarity and solvent-accessible surface accounts for van der Waals forces and solvation free energy. The scoring function is particularly suitable for modeling partially buried side chains. Both iterative and stochastic searching approaches are used. Our programs (Sccomp-I and Sccomp-S), with relatively fast execution times, correctly predict chi1 angles for 92-93\% of buried residues and 82-84\% for all residues, with an RMSD of approximately 1.7 A for side chain heavy atoms. We find that the differential between the atomic solvation parameters and the contact surface parameters (including those between noncomplementary atoms) is positive; i.e., most protein atoms prefer surface contact with other protein atoms rather than with the solvent. This might correspond to the driving force for maximizing packing of the protein. The influence of the crystal packing, completeness of rotamer library and precise positioning of Cbeta atoms on the accuracy of side-chain prediction are examined. The Sccomp-S and Sccomp-I programs can be accessed through the Web (http://sgedg.weizmann.ac.il/sccomp.html) and are available for several platforms.},

abstract = {Fragment based drug design has emerged as an effective alternative to high throughput screening for the identification of lead compounds in drug discovery in the past fifteen years. Fragment based screening and optimization methods have achieved credible success in many drug discovery projects with one approved drug and many more compounds in clinical trials. The fragment based drug design starts with the identification of fragments or low molecular weight compounds that generally bind with weak affinity to the target of interest. The fragments that form high quality interactions are then optimized to lead compounds with high affinity and selectivity. The weak affinity of fragments for their target requires the use of biophysical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography or surface plasmon resonance to identify hits. These techniques are very sensitive and some of them provide detailed protein fragment interaction information that is important for fragment to lead optimization. Despite the huge advances in technology in the past years, experimental methods of fragment screening suffer several challenges such as low throughput, high cost of instruments and experiments, high protein and fragment concentration requirements. To address challenges posed by experimental screening approaches, computational methods were developed that play an important role in fragment library design, fragment screening and optimization of initial fragment hits. The computational approaches of fragment screening and optimization are most useful when they are used in combination with experimental approaches. The use of virtual fragment based screening in combination with experimental methods has fostered the application of fragment based drug design to important biological targets including protein-protein interactions and membrane proteins such as GPCRs. This review provides an overview of experimental and computational screening approaches used in fragment based drug discovery with an emphasis on recent successes achieved in discovering potent lead molecules using these approaches.},

@article{Metz2001,
abstract = {Spectroscopically calibrated DFT is used to investigate the reaction coordinate of O(2) binding to Hemocyanin (Hc). A reaction path is calculated in which O(2) approaches the binuclear copper site with increasing metal-ligand overlap, which switches the coordination mode from end-on eta(1)-eta(1), to mu-eta(1):eta(2), then to butterfly, and finally to the planar [Cu(2)(mu-eta(2):eta(2)O(2))] structure. Analysis of the electronic structures during O(2) binding reveals that simultaneous two-electron transfer (ET) takes place. At early stages of O(2) binding the energy difference between the triplet and the singlet state is reduced by charge transfer (CT), which delocalizes the unpaired electrons and thus lowers the exchange stabilization onto the separated copper centers. The electron spins on the copper(II) ions are initially ferromagnetically coupled due to close to orthogonal magnetic orbital pathways through the dioxygen bridging ligand, and a change in the structure of the Cu(2)O(2) core turns on the superexchange coupling between the coppers. This favors the singlet state over the triplet state enabling intersystem crossing. Comparison with mononuclear model complexes indicates that the protein matrix holds the two copper(I) centers in close proximity, which enthalpically and entropically favors O(2) binding due to destabilization of the reduced binuclear site. This also allows regulation of the enthalpy by the change of the Cu--Cu distance in deoxyHc, which provides an explanation for the O(2) binding cooperativity in Hc. These results are compared to our earlier studies of Hemerythrin (Hr) and a common theme emerges where the spin forbiddeness of O(2) binding is overcome through delocalization of unpaired electrons onto the metal centers and the superexchange coupling of the metal centers via a ligand bridge.},

However, partly due to the limitations of proper computational tools for covalent docking, most covalent drugs are not discovered systematically. In this article, we present a new covalent docking package, the CovalentDock, built on the top of the source code of Autodock. We developed an empirical model of free energy change estimation for covalent linkage formation, which is compatible with existing scoring functions used in docking, while handling the molecular geometry constrains of the covalent linkage with special atom types and directional grid maps. Integrated preparation scripts are also written for the automation of the whole covalent docking workflow. The result tested on existing crystal structures with covalent linkage shows that CovalentDock can reproduce the native covalent complexes with significant improved accuracy when compared with the default covalent docking method in Autodock. Experiments also suggest that CovalentDock is capable of covalent virtual screening with satisfactory enrichment performance. In addition, the investigation on the results also shows that the chirality and target selectivity along with the molecular geometry constrains are well preserved by CovalentDock, showing great capability of this method in the application for covalent drug discovery.},

The X-ray structures of deoxygenated (deoxyHc) and oxygenated (oxyHc) hemocyanin are well reproduced by QM/MM geometry optimizations. The computed relative energies strongly depend on the chosen density functional. They are consistent with the available thermodynamic data for oxygen binding in hemocyanin and in synthetic model complexes when the BH\&HLYP hybrid functional with 50\% Hartree-Fock exchange is used. According to the QM(BH\&HLYP)/MM results, the reaction proceeds stepwise with two sequential electron transfer (ET) processes in the triplet state followed by an intersystem crossing to the singlet product. The first ET step leads to a nonbridged superoxo CuB(II)-O2(•-) intermediate via a low-barrier transition state. The second ET step is even more facile and yields a side-on oxyHc complex with the characteristic Cu2O2 butterfly core, accompanied by triplet-singlet intersystem crossing.

abstract = {Structure-based drug design is frequently used to accelerate the development of small-molecule therapeutics. Although substantial progress has been made in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the availability of high-resolution structures is limited owing to the frequent inability to crystallize or obtain sufficient NMR restraints for large or flexible proteins. Computational methods can be used to both predict unknown protein structures and model ligand interactions when experimental data are unavailable. This paper describes a comprehensive and detailed protocol using the Rosetta modeling suite to dock small-molecule ligands into comparative models. In the protocol presented here, we review the comparative modeling process, including sequence alignment, threading and loop building. Next, we cover docking a small-molecule ligand into the protein comparative model. In addition, we discuss criteria that can improve ligand docking into comparative models. Finally, and importantly, we present a strategy for assessing model quality. The entire protocol is presented on a single example selected solely for didactic purposes. The results are therefore not representative and do not replace benchmarks published elsewhere. We also provide an additional tutorial so that the user can gain hands-on experience in using Rosetta. The protocol should take 5-7 h, with additional time allocated for computer generation of models.},

@article{Moltedo2006,
abstract = {PURPOSE: We determined the antitumor properties of a newly available hemocyanin obtained from the Chilean gastropod Concholepas concholepas (Biosonda Corp., Santiago, Chile) in a syngeneic heterotopic mouse bladder carcinoma model. Since keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois) is used increasingly in biomedicine as a carrier for vaccines and an immunotherapeutic agent for bladder transitional cell carcinoma, there is a growing interest in finding new substances that share its potent immunomodulatory properties. Considering that keyhole limpet hemocyanin and Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin differ significantly, it was not possible to predict a priori the antitumor properties of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: C3H/He mice were primed with Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin before subcutaneous implantation of mouse bladder tumor-2 cells. Treatment consisted of a subcutaneous dose of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin (1 mg or 100 mug) at different intervals after implantation. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin and phosphate buffered saline served as positive and negative controls, respectively. In addition, experiments were designed to determine which elements of the immune response were involved in its adjuvant immunostimulatory effect.

RESULTS: Mice treated with Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin showed a significant antitumor effect, as demonstrated by decreased tumor growth and incidence, prolonged survival and lack of toxic effects. These effects were similar to those achieved with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. We found that each hemocyanin increased natural killer cell activity but the effect of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin was stronger. Analysis of serum from treated mice showed an increased interferon-gamma and low interleukin-4, which correlated with antibody isotypes, confirming that hemocyanins induce a T helper type 1 cytokine profile.

CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge our results are the first demonstration of the antitumor effect of a hemocyanin other than keyhole limpet hemocyanin. They suggest that this is an ancient conserved immunogenic mechanism shared by those hemocyanins that is able to enhance T helper type 1 immunity and lead to antitumor activity. Therefore, Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin may be an alternative candidate for providing safe and effective immunotherapy for human superficial bladder cancer.},

GDB contains 26.4 million molecules (110.9 million stereoisomers), including three- and four-membered rings and triple bonds. By comparison, only 63 857 compounds of up to 11 atoms were found in public databases (a combination of PubChem, ChemACX, ChemSCX, NCI open database, and the Merck Index). A total of 538 of the 1208 ring systems in GDB are currently unknown in the CAS Registry and Beilstein databases in any carbon/heteroatom/multiple-bond combination or as a substructure. Over 70\% of GDB molecules are chiral. Because of their small size, all compounds obey Lipinski's bioavailability rule. A total of 13.2 million compounds also follow Congreve's "Rule of 3" for lead-likeness. A Kohonen map trained with autocorrelation descriptors organizes GDB according to compound classes and shows that leadlike compounds are most abundant in chiral regions of fused carbocycles and fused heterocycles. The projection of known compounds into this map indicates large uncharted areas of chemical space. The potential of GDB for drug discovery is illustrated by virtual screening for kinase inhibitors, G-protein coupled receptor ligands, and ion-channel modulators. The database is available from the author's Web page.},

abstract = {The accurate modeling of metal coordination geometries plays an important role for structure-based drug design applied to metalloenzymes. For the development of a new metal interaction model, we perform a statistical analysis of metal interaction geometries that are relevant to protein-ligand complexes. A total of 43,061 metal sites of the Protein Data Bank (PDB), containing amongst others magnesium, calcium, zinc, iron, manganese, copper, cadmium, cobalt, and nickel, were evaluated according to their metal coordination geometry. Based on statistical analysis, we derived a model for the automatic calculation and definition of metal interaction geometries for the purpose of molecular docking analyses. It includes the identification of the metal-coordinating ligands, the calculation of the coordination geometry and the superposition of ideal polyhedra to identify the optimal positions for free coordination sites. The new interaction model was integrated in the docking software FlexX and evaluated on a data set of 103 metalloprotein-ligand complexes, which were extracted from the PDB. In a first step, the quality of the automatic calculation of the metal coordination geometry was analyzed. In 74\% of the cases, the correct prediction of the coordination geometry could be determined on the basis of the protein structure alone. Secondly, the new metal interaction model was tested in terms of predicting protein-ligand complexes. In the majority of test cases, the new interaction model resulted in an improved docking accuracy of the top ranking placements.},

@article{Hoksza2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemical space is virtual space occupied by all chemically meaningful organic compounds. It is an important concept in contemporary chemoinformatics research, and its systematic exploration is vital to the discovery of either novel drugs or new tools for chemical biology.

RESULTS: In this paper, we describe Molpher, an open-source framework for the systematic exploration of chemical space. Through a process we term 'molecular morphing', Molpher produces a path of structurally-related compounds. This path is generated by the iterative application of so-called 'morphing operators' that represent simple structural changes, such as the addition or removal of an atom or a bond. Molpher incorporates an optimized parallel exploration algorithm, compound logging and a two-dimensional visualization of the exploration process. Its feature set can be easily extended by implementing additional morphing operators, chemical fingerprints, similarity measures and visualization methods. Molpher not only offers an intuitive graphical user interface, but also can be run in batch mode. This enables users to easily incorporate molecular morphing into their existing drug discovery pipelines.

CONCLUSIONS: Molpher is an open-source software framework for the design of virtual chemical libraries focused on a particular mechanistic class of compounds. These libraries, represented by a morphing path and its surroundings, provide valuable starting data for future in silico and in vitro experiments. Molpher is highly extensible and can be easily incorporated into any existing computational drug design pipeline.},

It is our hope that this will permit labs that have not considered protein design to apply it to their own systems, thereby increasing its potential as a tool in biology.

abstract = {The estimation of free energy of binding is a key problem in structure-based design. We developed the scoring function HYDE based on a consistent description of HYdrogen bond and DEhydration energies in protein-ligand complexes. HYDE is applicable to all types of protein targets since it is not calibrated on experimental binding affinity data or protein-ligand complexes. The comprehensible atom-based score of HYDE is visualized by applying a very intuitive coloring scheme, thereby facilitating the analysis of protein-ligand complexes in the lead optimization process. In this paper, we have revised several aspects of the former version of HYDE which was described in detail previously. The revised HYDE version was already validated in large-scale redocking and screening experiments which were performed in the course of the Docking and Scoring Symposium at 241st ACS National Meeting. In this study, we additionally evaluate the ability of the revised HYDE version to predict binding affinities. On the PDBbind 2007 coreset, HYDE achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.62 between the experimental binding constants and the predicted binding energy, performing second best on this dataset compared to 17 other well-established scoring functions. Further, we show that the performance of HYDE in large-scale redocking and virtual screening experiments on the Astex diverse set and the DUD dataset respectively, is comparable to the best methods in this field.},

It is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons and dystrophic neurons. Several risk factors are associated with the early onset and progression of the disease. Although the initiating molecular events are not entirely known, in recent years it has become evident that environmental and/or nutritional factors may play a causal, disruptive, and/or protective role in the development of AD. While a direct causal role for aluminum or other transition metals (copper, zinc, iron) in AD has not yet been definitively demonstrated, epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated levels of these metals in the brain may be linked to the development or progression of AD. This review summarizes studies which implicate a role for several metals in contributing to or causing AD.},

abstract = {Target-based drug discovery must assess many drug-like compounds for potential activity. Focusing on low-molecular-weight compounds (fragments) can dramatically reduce the chemical search space. However, approaches for determining protein-fragment interactions have limitations. Experimental assays are time-consuming, expensive, and not always applicable. At the same time, computational approaches using physics-based methods have limited accuracy. With increasing high-resolution structural data for protein-ligand complexes, there is now an opportunity for data-driven approaches to fragment binding prediction. We present FragFEATURE, a machine learning approach to predict small molecule fragments preferred by a target protein structure. We first create a knowledge base of protein structural environments annotated with the small molecule substructures they bind. These substructures have low-molecular weight and serve as a proxy for fragments. FragFEATURE then compares the structural environments within a target protein to those in the knowledge base to retrieve statistically preferred fragments. It merges information across diverse ligands with shared substructures to generate predictions. Our results demonstrate FragFEATURE's ability to rediscover fragments corresponding to the ligand bound with 74\% precision and 82\% recall on average. For many protein targets, it identifies high scoring fragments that are substructures of known inhibitors. FragFEATURE thus predicts fragments that can serve as inputs to fragment-based drug design or serve as refinement criteria for creating target-specific compound libraries for experimental or computational screening.},

abstract = {We have developed a fast procedure to predict solvation free energies for both organic and biological molecules. This solvation model is based on weighted solvent accessible surface area (WSAS). Least-squares fittings have been applied to optimize the weights of SAS for different atom types in order to reproduce the experimental solvation free energies. Good agreement with experimental results has been obtained. For the 184-molecule set (model I), for which there are experimental solvation free energies in 1-octanol, we have achieved an average error of 0.36 kcal/mol, better than that of the SM5.42R universal solvation model1 by Li et al. For the 245-molecule set (model II) that has experimental aqueous solvation free energies, our WSAS model achieves an average error of 0.48 kcal/mol, marginally larger than that of Li's model (0.46 kcal/mol). We have used a 401-molecule set, the largest training set (model IV) that we know of solvation model development, to derive the SAS weights in order to reproduce the experimental solvation free energies in water. For this model, we have achieved an average unsigned error of 0.54 kcal/mol and an RMS error of 0.79 kcal/mol.The advantage of this model lies in its simplicity and independence of charge models. We have successfully applied this model to predict the relative binding free energies for the five binding modes of HIV-1RT/efavirenz. The most favorable binding mode, which has an RMSD of 1.1 \&Aring; (for 54 C around the binding site) compared to the crystal structure, has a binding free energy at least 10 kcal/mol more negative than the other binding modes. Moreover, the solvation free energies with WSAS have a high correlation (the correlation coefficient is 0.92) to the solvation free energies calculated by the Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (PBSA) model. As an efficient and fast approach, WASA is also attractive for protein modeling and protein folding studies. We have applied this model to predict the solvation free energies of the 36-mer villin headpiece subdomain in its native structure, a compact folding intermediate, and a random coil. The rank order of the solvation free energies and the free energies for the three kinds of conformational clusters are in reasonable agreement with those found by MM-PBSA, a widely used solvation free energy model.},

For this purpose, metal content was analyzed after size-fractionation of species and then, inter-element and inter-fraction ratios were computed. In this way, the analysis allowed discovering changes that could be used as markers of disease, but also provided a new insight into the interactions in the homeostasis of elements in neurodegeneration and its progression. Aluminum and labile forms of iron and copper were increased in demented patients, while manganese, zinc and selenium were reduced. Interestingly, levels of different elements, principally iron, aluminum and manganese, were closely inter-related, which could evidence a complex interdependency between the homeostasis of the different metals in this disorder. On the other hand, imbalances in metabolism of copper, zinc and selenium could be associated to abnormal redox status. Therefore, this study may contribute to our understanding of the pathological mechanisms related to metals in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {We developed a new empirical scoring function, HYDE, for the evaluation of protein-ligand complexes. HYDE estimates binding free energy based on two terms for dehydration and hydrogen bonding only. The essential feature of this scoring function is the integrated use of log P-derived atomic increments for the prediction of free dehydration energy and hydrogen bonding energy. Taking the dehydration of atoms within the interface into account shows that some atoms contribute favorably to the overall score, while others contribute unfavorably. For instance, hydrogen bond functions are penalized if they are dehydrated unless they can overcompensate this loss by forming a hydrogen bond with excellent geometry. The main stabilizing contribution represents the removal of apolar groups from the water: the hydrophobic effect. Initial studies using the DUD dataset show that with HYDE, there is a significant decrease in false positives, a reasonable categorization of compounds as either non-binders, weak, medium or strong binders, and in particular, there is a generally applicable and thermodynamically sensible cutoff score below which there is a high likelihood that the compound is indeed a binder.},

abstract = {Amino acids have sidechain rotamer preferences dependent on the backbone dihedral angles phi and psi. These preferences provide a method for rapid structure prediction which is a significant improvement over backbone-independent rotamer libraries. We demonstrate here that simple arguments based on conformational analysis can account for many of the features of the observed backbone dependence of the sidechain rotamers. Steric repulsions corresponding to the 'butane' and 'syn-pentane' effects make certain conformers rare, as has been observed experimentally.},

abstract = {The "small molecule universe" (SMU), the set of all synthetically feasible organic molecules of 500 Da molecular weight or less, is estimated to contain over 10(60) structures, making exhaustive searches for structures of interest impractical. Here, we describe the construction of a "representative universal library" spanning the SMU that samples the full extent of feasible small molecule chemistries. This library was generated using the newly developed Algorithm for Chemical Space Exploration with Stochastic Search (ACSESS). ACSESS makes two important contributions to chemical space exploration: it allows the systematic search of the unexplored regions of the small molecule universe, and it facilitates the mining of chemical libraries that do not yet exist, providing a near-infinite source of diverse novel compounds.},

abstract = {AutoDock Vina, a new program for molecular docking and virtual screening, is presented. AutoDock Vina achieves an approximately two orders of magnitude speed-up compared with the molecular docking software previously developed in our lab (AutoDock 4), while also significantly improving the accuracy of the binding mode predictions, judging by our tests on the training set used in AutoDock 4 development. Further speed-up is achieved from parallelism, by using multithreading on multicore machines. AutoDock Vina automatically calculates the grid maps and clusters the results in a way transparent to the user.},

@book{Lippard1994,
abstract = {As one of the most dynamic fields in contemporary science, bioinorganic chemistry lies at a natural juncture between chemistry, biology, and medicine. This rapidly expanding field probes fascinating questions about the uses of metal ions in nature. Respiration, metabolism, photosynthesis, gene regulation, and nerve impulse transmission are a few of the many natural processes that require metal ions, and new systems are continually being discovered. The use of unnatural metals - which have been introduced into human biology as diagnostic probes and drugs - is another active area of tremendous medical significance. This introductory text, written by two pioneering researchers, is destined to become a landmark in the field of bioinorganic chemistry through its organized unification of key topics. Accessible to undergraduates, the book provides necessary background information on coordination chemistry, biochemistry, and physical methods before delving into topics that are central to the field: What metals are chosen and how are they taken up by cells? How are the concentrations of metals controlled and utilized in cells? How do metals bind to and fold biomolecules? What principles govern electron transfer and substrate binding and activation reactions? How do proteins fine-tune the properties of metals for specific functions? For each topic discussed, fundamentals are identified and then clarified through selected examples. An extraordinarily readable writing style combines with chapter-opening principles, study problems, and beautifully rendered two-color illustrations to make this book an ideal choice for instructors, students, and researchers in the chemical, biological, and medicalcommunities.},

@article{Schneider2012,
abstract = {The HYDE scoring function consistently describes hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic effect and desolvation. It relies on HYdration and DEsolvation terms which are calibrated using octanol/water partition coefficients of small molecules. We do not use affinity data for calibration, therefore HYDE is generally applicable to all protein targets. HYDE reflects the Gibbs free energy of binding while only considering the essential interactions of protein-ligand complexes. The greatest benefit of HYDE is that it yields a very intuitive atom-based score, which can be mapped onto the ligand and protein atoms. This allows the direct visualization of the score and consequently facilitates analysis of protein-ligand complexes during the lead optimization process. In this study, we validated our new scoring function by applying it in large-scale docking experiments. We could successfully predict the correct binding mode in 93\% of complexes in redocking calculations on the Astex diverse set, while our performance in virtual screening experiments using the DUD dataset showed significant enrichment values with a mean AUC of 0.77 across all protein targets with little or no structural defects. As part of these studies, we also carried out a very detailed analysis of the data that revealed interesting pitfalls, which we highlight here and which should be addressed in future benchmark datasets.},
