Conclusions
===========
GAUDI has proved to be a valid proof of concept. Simplistic energy calculation terms do generate good results if combined with the appropriate restraints, which is one of the most powerful strengths of this software. It can help molecular designers with a rapid sketching tool that will produce feasible in results in a reasonable amount of time. 

Further work
============

- Further development of the spatial exploration engine: improve docking results
- Protein flexibility through normal modes
- More objectives: Metal coordination geometries (not just visual aid), inertial axes
- QM/MM minimization interface from GaudiView: direct refinement from the GUI
- Performance improvements: parallelization, code refinement
- Custom frcmods input as an energy term
