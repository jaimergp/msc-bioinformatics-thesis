1. Enzymes and organometallics
==============================
Life can be seen as a beautifully orchestrated succession of chemical reactions. Most of those reactions could not take place outside cells or, if they did, they would take an unaffordable amount of time. So, how do cells manage to do that? The answer lies in enzymes.

Enzymes are cell-tailored catalysts that provide the necessary environment for biological reactions to take place. The enzymes we know are the product of millions of years of evolution. During that period of time, nature has been sculpting their structure and functionality, so they become better and better at doing their job. This results in a very specific chemospatial context that greatly lowers the energetic barrier of the transition state, allowing the reaction to happen at mild conditions in a very short period of time. 

To fulfil their role, most enzymes do not transform the substrate on their own. Instead, they are helped by a variable number of small diverse molecules called cofactors. One of the more interesting types of cofactors are transition metal compounds.

Transition metals exhibit unique chemical properties due to their versatile electronic configuration. Thus, metals present a wide range of oxidation states. They are able to coordinate to other atoms featuring a number of different geometries, which confers enough stability while keeping its distinguishing reactivity.
