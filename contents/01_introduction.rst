1. Molecular Design and Docking: the missing middle ground
==========================================================

Methodologic funnel. GAUDI is sitting on the top of the funnel, because it has to deal with a HUGE HUGE search space that comprises more dimensions than a simple docking essay (in which 90% of the leading forces have to do with non-covalent interactions), so some precision must sacrificed in exchange of speed.

2. Current molecular design strategies
======================================

|

2.1. Available software and strategies in use
---------------------------------------------

|

3. Current docking approaches have their limitations
====================================================

|

3.1. Calculations involving metals
----------------------------------

- This a result of force-field based approaches.


3.2. Covalent docking is not very developed
-------------------------------------------
