1. Enzymes and organometallics
==============================
Life can be seen as a beautifully orchestrated succession of chemical reactions. Most of those reactions could not take place outside cells or, if they did, they would take an unaffordable amount of time. So, how do cells manage to do that? The answer lies in enzymes.

Enzymes are cell-tailored catalysts that provide the necessary environment for biological reactions to take place. The enzymes we know are the product of millions of years of evolution. During that period of time, nature has been sculpting their structure and functionality, so that they become better and better at doing their job. This results in a very specific chemospatial context that greatly lowers the energetic barrier of the transition state, allowing the reaction to happen at mild conditions in a very short period of time. 

To fulfil their role, most enzymes do not transform the substrate on their own. Instead, they are helped by a variable number of small diverse molecules called cofactors. One of the more interesting types of cofactors are transition metal compounds.

Transition metals exhibit unique chemical properties due to their versatile electronic configuration which allows them to present a wide range of oxidation states. Subsequently, they are able to coordinate to other atoms featuring a number of different geometries, which confers enough stability without renouncing to its distinguishing reactivity.

Artificial metalloenzymes seek to combine the specificity of biocatalysts with the reaction possibilities of organometallic groups in a single system. De novo design is still far from being doable, but meanwhile some other less ambitious approaches have been reported successful, such as DNA-based catalysts :cite:`Roelfes2005` and several types of protein-based designs. In this former group, three main strategies can be detailed, based on the type of ligand anchoring: dative, covalent or supramolecular :cite:`Steinreiber2008`.

1.1 Streptavidin-biotin technology
----------------------------------
Biotin --- also known as vitamin B7 or H --- is the natural ligand of (strept)avidin, and they both make for a well-known couple in biology due to manifesting the strongest non-covalent interaction in nature: the dissociation constant gets up to :math:`K_d \approx 10^{-14}M` :cite:`Green1975`. The complex is also greatly resistant to extreme pH and temperature levels, organic solvents, proteolytic enzymes and other adverse conditions. All of these features make the system an excellent candidate for supramolecular anchoring techniques and biotechnological developments. So far, this has been one of the most successful strategies in the field.

    Ward et al. are actively working on streptavidin-biotin based systems to implement diverse metallogroups. One of their results is an artificial hydrogenase (PDB: 3PK2, :citein:`Ward2011`), in which a catalyst (violet dye) is covalently linked to a biotin (grey dye) inside the streptavidin pocket (brown surface). This way, the biotin acts as an anchor that helps place the catalyst inside the streptavidin scaffold. 
    
1.2 Oxygen transport in invertebrates: hemocyanins
--------------------------------------------------
Hemocyanins are oxygen-carrier proteins that can be found in some invertebrate animals, such as snails, crabs, lobsters or spiders. The transport is achieved thanks to two copper atoms that reversibly bind an oxygen molecule. Oxygen-binding capabilities of copper often result in comparisons with biological iron, though some differences exist. For example, iron is usually found in tetrapyrrole coordinated compounds, while copper prefers imine-nitrogen atoms. In the case of hemocyanin, its two coppers coordinate to three histidines each, favouring the dioxygen binding in an global singlet electronic configuration.

    Hemocyanin features a histidine-coordinated di-copper centre that reversibly binds a single molecule of oxygen. This depiction shows the oxygenated form of *Limulus polyphemus*' hemocyanin (PDB: 1NOL, :citein:`Hazes1993`).

2. The challenge: an artificial hemocyanin
==========================================
One of the new experiments Ward's group is working in is an artificial hemocyanin, built upon the streptavidin-biotin system in which the imine-nitrogens are supplied by the biotin-anchored linkers. Several wet-lab attempts have been tried, but none of them have succeeded --- it may be due to unexpected hydrophobic interactions between the linkers and streptavidin, as well as insufficient linkers length. Also, to date, the constructions that has been successful only comprised a single ligand plugged in the cofactor of each monomer. However, this novel idea proposes a bridging structure between the monomers, which further complicates the problem: existent software can barely handle a single covalent interaction, let alone two or more bonds. In order to shed light on the problem, a GAUDI simulation was run based on the following experiment requirements.

    1. The hemocyanin core must be placed around the interface region of the two hemocyanin subunits.
    2. It must be covalently linked to the two biotins that reside in each of the afore-mentioned subunits.
    3. Subsequently, two linkers of unknown length have to be used to connect the biotins with the hemocyanin core.

3. Our strategy
===============
The problem was implemented in GAUDI following what we call an *anchor & seek* strategy. This approach consists of a covalent bond restraint on one end of the dynamically constructed ligand and one covalent-suitable distance objective on the other end. The built-in genetic algorithm will then optimize the linkers length and their torsion angles to help the chain reach the other biotin while minimizing the clashes and maximizing hydrogen bond forming and hydrophobic interactions.

The dynamical builder was fed with this overall structure: ``linker - hemocyanin core - linker``. The so-called ``linker`` block could be represented by any of the following compounds: ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane and octane. The ``hemocyanin core`` block was sketched in ChemDraw following a draft provided by Ward (see figure below) and then QM-minimized with Gaussian09 :cite:`g09` using a M06-2X functional (which features a 54% Hartree-Fock exchange), charge +2 and open-shell singlet configuration, as suggested by previous studies :cite:`Saito2014,Metz2001`. The resulting structure was then converted into a standard GAUDI-compatible Mol2 file, which was intentionally left rigid.

    Ward's group supplied a draft of the di-copper centre, which was later converted into a standard mol2 file with ChemBio3D. The resulting file was then minimized with Gaussian09 using an M06-2X functional.

An initial population of 1000 individuals was created and evolved for 300 generations with a crossover probability of 0.8 and mutation rate of 0.1. Three distances objectives were asked: the free end of the ligand should approach the terminal-N of the biotin in the other subunit to meet a covalent-suitable distance, while each of the side carbons in the N-rings of the copper scaffolds should approach K109 and K233, which may be able to facilitate additional anchoring to help fix the long chain. An idealization of the final requirements is depicted below.

The resulting Pareto front consisted of **XXX** individuals, a selection of which was extracted following these score constrains in GaudiView GUI:
