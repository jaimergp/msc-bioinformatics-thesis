abstract = {It is widely recognized that atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD), a classical simulation method, captures the essential physics of protein dynamics. That idea is supported by a theoretical study showing that various MD force-fields provide a consensus picture of protein fluctuations in aqueous solution [Rueda, M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007, 104, 796?801]. However, atomistic MD cannot be applied to most biologically relevant processes due to its limitation to relatively short time scales. Much longer time scales can be accessed by properly designed coarse-grained models. We demonstrate that the aforementioned consensus view of protein dynamics from short (nanosecond) time scale MD simulations is fairly consistent with the dynamics of the coarse-grained protein model - the CABS model. The CABS model employs stochastic dynamics (a Monte Carlo method) and a knowledge-based force-field, which is not biased toward the native structure of a simulated protein. Since CABS-based dynamics allows for the simulation of entire folding (or multiple folding events) in a single run, integration of the CABS approach with all-atom MD promises a convenient (and computationally feasible) means for the long-time multiscale molecular modeling of protein systems with atomistic resolution.

@article{ToledoWarshaviak2014,
abstract = {We present a fast and effective covalent docking approach suitable for large-scale virtual screening (VS). We applied this method to four targets (HCV NS3 protease, Cathepsin K, EGFR, and XPO1) with known crystal structures and known covalent inhibitors. We implemented a customized "VS mode" of the Schr\"{o}dinger Covalent Docking algorithm (CovDock), which we refer to as CovDock-VS. Known actives and target-specific sets of decoys were docked to selected X-ray structures, and poses were filtered based on noncovalent protein-ligand interactions known to be important for activity. We were able to retrieve 71\%, 72\%, and 77\% of the known actives for Cathepsin K, HCV NS3 protease, and EGFR within 5\% of the decoy library, respectively. With the more challenging XPO1 target, where no specific interactions with the protein could be used for postprocessing of the docking results, we were able to retrieve 95\% of the actives within 30\% of the decoy library and achieved an early enrichment factor (EF1\%) of 33. The poses of the known actives bound to existing crystal structures of 4 targets were predicted with an average RMSD of 1.9 \AA. To the best of our knowledge, CovDock-VS is the first fully automated tool for efficient virtual screening of covalent inhibitors. Importantly, CovDock-VS can handle multiple chemical reactions within the same library, only requiring a generic SMARTS-based predefinition of the reaction. CovDock-VS provides a fast and accurate way of differentiating actives from decoys without significantly deteriorating the accuracy of the predicted poses for covalent protein-ligand complexes. Therefore, we propose CovDock-VS as an efficient structure-based virtual screening method for discovery of novel and diverse covalent ligands.},

@article{Ahmed2011,
abstract = {A three-step approach for multiscale modeling of protein conformational changes is presented that incorporates information about preferred directions of protein motions into a geometric simulation algorithm. The first two steps are based on a rigid cluster normal-mode analysis (RCNMA). Low-frequency normal modes are used in the third step (NMSim) to extend the recently introduced idea of constrained geometric simulations of diffusive motions in proteins by biasing backbone motions of the protein, whereas side-chain motions are biased toward favorable rotamer states. The generated structures are iteratively corrected regarding steric clashes and stereochemical constraint violations. The approach allows performing three simulation types: unbiased exploration of conformational space; pathway generation by a targeted simulation; and radius of gyration-guided simulation. When applied to a data set of proteins with experimentally observed conformational changes, conformational variabilities are reproduced very well for 4 out of 5 proteins that show domain motions, with correlation coefficients r > 0.70 and as high as r = 0.92 in the case of adenylate kinase. In 7 out of 8 cases, NMSim simulations starting from unbound structures are able to sample conformations that are similar (root-mean-square deviation = 1.0-3.1 \AA) to ligand bound conformations. An NMSim generated pathway of conformational change of adenylate kinase correctly describes the sequence of domain closing. The NMSim approach is a computationally efficient alternative to molecular dynamics simulations for conformational sampling of proteins. The generated conformations and pathways of conformational transitions can serve as input to docking approaches or as starting points for more sophisticated sampling techniques.},

@article{Hazes1993,
abstract = {The crystal structure of Limulus polyphemus subunit type II hemocyanin in the deoxygenated state has been determined to a resolution of 2.18 A. Phase information for this first structure of a cheliceratan hemocyanin was obtained by molecular replacement using the crustacean hemocyanin structure of Panulirus interruptus. The most striking observation in the Limulus structure is the unexpectedly large distance of 4.6 A between both copper ions in the oxygen-binding site. Each copper has approximate trigonal planar coordination by three histidine N epsilon atoms. No bridging ligand between the copper ions could be detected. Other important new discoveries are (1) the presence of a cis-peptide bond between Glu 309 and Ser 310, with the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide plane hydrogen bonded to the N delta atom of the copper B ligand His 324; (2) localization of a chloride-binding site in the interface between the first and second domain; (3) localization of a putative calcium-binding site in the third domain. Furthermore, comparison of Limulus versus Panulirus hemocyanin revealed considerable tertiary and quaternary rigid body movements, although the overall folds are similar. Within the subunit, the first domain is rotated by about 7.5 degrees with respect to the other two domains, whereas within the hexamer the major movement is a 3.1 degrees rotation of the trimers with respect to each other. The rigid body rotation of the first domain suggests a structural mechanism for the allosteric regulation by chloride ions and probably causes the cooperative transition of the hexamer between low and high oxygen affinity states. In this postulated mechanism, the fully conserved Phe49 is the key residue that couples conformational changes of the dinuclear copper site into movements of the first domain.},

abstract = {In order to study the involvement of metals in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, serum samples from patients with Alzheimer and mild cognitive impairment were investigated. For this purpose, metal content was analyzed after size-fractionation of species and then, inter-element and inter-fraction ratios were computed. In this way, the analysis allowed discovering changes that could be used as markers of disease, but also provided a new insight into the interactions in the homeostasis of elements in neurodegeneration and its progression. Aluminum and labile forms of iron and copper were increased in demented patients, while manganese, zinc and selenium were reduced. Interestingly, levels of different elements, principally iron, aluminum and manganese, were closely inter-related, which could evidence a complex interdependency between the homeostasis of the different metals in this disorder. On the other hand, imbalances in metabolism of copper, zinc and selenium could be associated to abnormal redox status. Therefore, this study may contribute to our understanding of the pathological mechanisms related to metals in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {New methods for the synthesis of artificial metalloenzymes are important for the construction of novel biocatalysts and biomaterials. Recently, we reported new methodology for the synthesis of artificial metalloenzymes by reconstituting apo-myoglobin with metal complexes (Ohashi, M. et al., Angew Chem., Int. Ed. 2003, 42, 1005-1008). However, it has been difficult to improve their reactivity, since their crystal structures were not available. In this article, we report the crystal structures of M(III)(Schiff base).apo-A71GMbs (M = Cr and Mn). The structures suggest that the position of the metal complex in apo-Mb is regulated by (i) noncovalent interaction between the ligand and surrounding peptides and (ii) the ligation of the metal ion to proximal histidine (His93). In addition, it is proposed that specific interactions of Ile107 with 3- and 3'-substituent groups on the salen ligand control the location of the Schiff base ligand in the active site. On the basis of these results, we have successfully controlled the enantioselectivity in the sulfoxidation of thioanisole by changing the size of substituents at the 3 and 3' positions. This is the first example of an enantioselective enzymatic reaction regulated by the design of metal complex in the protein active site.},

abstract = {We have developed a fast procedure to predict solvation free energies for both organic and biological molecules. This solvation model is based on weighted solvent accessible surface area (WSAS). Least-squares fittings have been applied to optimize the weights of SAS for different atom types in order to reproduce the experimental solvation free energies. Good agreement with experimental results has been obtained. For the 184-molecule set (model I), for which there are experimental solvation free energies in 1-octanol, we have achieved an average error of 0.36 kcal/mol, better than that of the SM5.42R universal solvation model1 by Li et al. For the 245-molecule set (model II) that has experimental aqueous solvation free energies, our WSAS model achieves an average error of 0.48 kcal/mol, marginally larger than that of Li's model (0.46 kcal/mol). We have used a 401-molecule set, the largest training set (model IV) that we know of solvation model development, to derive the SAS weights in order to reproduce the experimental solvation free energies in water. For this model, we have achieved an average unsigned error of 0.54 kcal/mol and an RMS error of 0.79 kcal/mol.The advantage of this model lies in its simplicity and independence of charge models. We have successfully applied this model to predict the relative binding free energies for the five binding modes of HIV-1RT/efavirenz. The most favorable binding mode, which has an RMSD of 1.1 \&Aring; (for 54 C around the binding site) compared to the crystal structure, has a binding free energy at least 10 kcal/mol more negative than the other binding modes. Moreover, the solvation free energies with WSAS have a high correlation (the correlation coefficient is 0.92) to the solvation free energies calculated by the Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (PBSA) model. As an efficient and fast approach, WASA is also attractive for protein modeling and protein folding studies. We have applied this model to predict the solvation free energies of the 36-mer villin headpiece subdomain in its native structure, a compact folding intermediate, and a random coil. The rank order of the solvation free energies and the free energies for the three kinds of conformational clusters are in reasonable agreement with those found by MM-PBSA, a widely used solvation free energy model.},

abstract = {Computational molecular design is a useful tool in modern drug discovery. Virtual screening is an approach that docks and then scores individual members of compound libraries. In contrast to this forward approach, inverse approaches construct compounds from fragments, such that the computed affinity, or a combination of relevant properties, is optimized. We have recently developed a new inverse approach to drug design based on the dead-end elimination and A* algorithms employing a physical potential function. This approach has been applied to combinatorially constructed libraries of small-molecule ligands to design high-affinity HIV-1 protease inhibitors (Altman et al., J Am Chem Soc 2008;130:6099-6013). Here we have evaluated the new method using the well-studied W191G mutant of cytochrome c peroxidase. This mutant possesses a charged binding pocket and has been used to evaluate other design approaches. The results show that overall the new inverse approach does an excellent job of separating binders from nonbinders. For a few individual cases, scoring inaccuracies led to false positives. The majority of these involve erroneous solvation energy estimation for charged amines, anilinium ions, and phenols, which has been observed previously for a variety of scoring algorithms. Interestingly, although inverse approaches are generally expected to identify some but not all binders in a library, due to limited conformational searching, these results show excellent coverage of the known binders while still showing strong discrimination of the nonbinders.},

abstract = {Recent advances in computational protein design have established it as a viable technique for the rational generation of stable protein sequences, novel protein folds, and even enzymatic activity. We present a new and object-oriented library of code, written specifically for protein design applications in C(++), called EGAD Library. The modular fashion in which this library is written allows developers to tailor various energy functions and minimizers for a specific purpose. It also allows for the generation of novel protein design applications with a minimal amount of code investment. It is our hope that this will permit labs that have not considered protein design to apply it to their own systems, thereby increasing its potential as a tool in biology. We also present various uses of EGAD Library: in the development of Interaction Viewer, a PyMOL plug-in for viewing interactions between protein residues; in the repacking of protein cores; and in the prediction of protein-protein complex stabilities.},

abstract = {The HYDE scoring function consistently describes hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic effect and desolvation. It relies on HYdration and DEsolvation terms which are calibrated using octanol/water partition coefficients of small molecules. We do not use affinity data for calibration, therefore HYDE is generally applicable to all protein targets. HYDE reflects the Gibbs free energy of binding while only considering the essential interactions of protein-ligand complexes. The greatest benefit of HYDE is that it yields a very intuitive atom-based score, which can be mapped onto the ligand and protein atoms. This allows the direct visualization of the score and consequently facilitates analysis of protein-ligand complexes during the lead optimization process. In this study, we validated our new scoring function by applying it in large-scale docking experiments. We could successfully predict the correct binding mode in 93\% of complexes in redocking calculations on the Astex diverse set, while our performance in virtual screening experiments using the DUD dataset showed significant enrichment values with a mean AUC of 0.77 across all protein targets with little or no structural defects. As part of these studies, we also carried out a very detailed analysis of the data that revealed interesting pitfalls, which we highlight here and which should be addressed in future benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the discovery, isolation, abundance, and distribution of aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium. Aluminum is a major constituent of many common igneous minerals, including feldspars and micas. Gallium, indium, and thallium are less abundant than aluminum and tend to occur at low concentrations in sulfide minerals rather than in oxides. The chapter describes the preparation and uses of the aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium. The production of aluminum metal involves two stages: first, the extraction, purification, and dehydration of bauxite, and, second, the process of electrolysis of aluminum oxide dissolved in molten cryolite. The chapter also discusses the atomic and physical properties of aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium. Indium is a soft and silvery metal with a brilliant luster. Its important applications are in low-melting alloys and in electronic devices. Technical-grade thallium is purified from other flue-dust elements by dissolving it in warm dilute acid and then precipitating the insoluble lead sulfate and adding hydrogen chloride to precipitate thallium chloride.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We determined the antitumor properties of a newly available hemocyanin obtained from the Chilean gastropod Concholepas concholepas (Biosonda Corp., Santiago, Chile) in a syngeneic heterotopic mouse bladder carcinoma model. Since keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois) is used increasingly in biomedicine as a carrier for vaccines and an immunotherapeutic agent for bladder transitional cell carcinoma, there is a growing interest in finding new substances that share its potent immunomodulatory properties. Considering that keyhole limpet hemocyanin and Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin differ significantly, it was not possible to predict a priori the antitumor properties of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: C3H/He mice were primed with Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin before subcutaneous implantation of mouse bladder tumor-2 cells. Treatment consisted of a subcutaneous dose of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin (1 mg or 100 mug) at different intervals after implantation. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin and phosphate buffered saline served as positive and negative controls, respectively. In addition, experiments were designed to determine which elements of the immune response were involved in its adjuvant immunostimulatory effect.

RESULTS: Mice treated with Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin showed a significant antitumor effect, as demonstrated by decreased tumor growth and incidence, prolonged survival and lack of toxic effects. These effects were similar to those achieved with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. We found that each hemocyanin increased natural killer cell activity but the effect of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin was stronger. Analysis of serum from treated mice showed an increased interferon-gamma and low interleukin-4, which correlated with antibody isotypes, confirming that hemocyanins induce a T helper type 1 cytokine profile.

CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge our results are the first demonstration of the antitumor effect of a hemocyanin other than keyhole limpet hemocyanin. They suggest that this is an ancient conserved immunogenic mechanism shared by those hemocyanins that is able to enhance T helper type 1 immunity and lead to antitumor activity. Therefore, Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin may be an alternative candidate for providing safe and effective immunotherapy for human superficial bladder cancer.},

abstract = {The task of generating a nonredundant set of low-energy conformations for small molecules is of fundamental importance for many molecular modeling and drug-design methodologies. Several approaches to conformer generation have been published. Exhaustive searches suffer from the exponential growth of the search space with increasing degrees of conformational freedom (number of rotatable bonds). Stochastic algorithms do not suffer as much from the exponential increase of search space and provide a good coverage of the energy minima. Here, the use of a multiobjective genetic algorithm in the generation of conformer ensembles is investigated. Distance geometry is used to generate an initial conformer, which is then subject to geometric modifications encoded by the individuals of the genetic algorithm. The geometric modifications apply to torsion angles about rotatable bonds, stereochemistry of double bonds and tetrahedral chiral centers, and ring conformations. The geometric diversity of the evolving conformer ensemble is preserved by a fitness-sharing mechanism based on the root-mean-square distance of the atomic coordinates. Molecular symmetry is taken into account in the distance calculation. The geometric modifications introduce strain into the structures. The strain is relaxed using an MMFF94-like force field in a postprocessing step that also removes conformational duplicates and structures whose strain energy remains above a predefined window from the minimum energy value found in the set. The implementation, called Balloon, is available free of charge on the Internet ( http://www.abo.fi/\~{}mivainio/balloon/).},

RESULTS: Confab generates conformations using the 'torsion driving approach' which involves iterating systematically through a set of allowed torsion angles for each rotatable bond. Energy is assessed using the MMFF94 forcefield. Diversity is measured using the heavy-atom root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) relative to conformers already stored. We investigated the recovery of crystal structures for a dataset of 1000 ligands from the Protein Data Bank with fewer than 1 million conformations. Confab can recover 97\% of the molecules to within 1.5 \AA at a diversity level of 1.5 \AA and an energy cutoff of 50 kcal/mol.

Interestingly, while protein-ligand dockings have long become a spearhead in computer assisted drug design, no benchmarking nor optimization have been done for their use with organometallic compounds. Pursuing our efforts to model metal mediated recognition processes, we herein present a systematic study of the capabilities of the program GOLD to predict the interactions of protein with organometallic compounds. The study focuses on inert systems for which no alteration of the first coordination sphere of the metal occurs upon binding. Several scaffolds are used as test systems with different docking schemes and scoring functions. We conclude that ChemScore is the most robust scoring function with ASP and ChemPLP providing with good results too and GoldScore slightly underperforming. This study shows that current state-of-the-art protein-ligand docking techniques are reliable for the docking of inert organometallic compounds binding to protein.},

abstract = {The estimation of free energy of binding is a key problem in structure-based design. We developed the scoring function HYDE based on a consistent description of HYdrogen bond and DEhydration energies in protein-ligand complexes. HYDE is applicable to all types of protein targets since it is not calibrated on experimental binding affinity data or protein-ligand complexes. The comprehensible atom-based score of HYDE is visualized by applying a very intuitive coloring scheme, thereby facilitating the analysis of protein-ligand complexes in the lead optimization process. In this paper, we have revised several aspects of the former version of HYDE which was described in detail previously. The revised HYDE version was already validated in large-scale redocking and screening experiments which were performed in the course of the Docking and Scoring Symposium at 241st ACS National Meeting. In this study, we additionally evaluate the ability of the revised HYDE version to predict binding affinities. On the PDBbind 2007 coreset, HYDE achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.62 between the experimental binding constants and the predicted binding energy, performing second best on this dataset compared to 17 other well-established scoring functions. Further, we show that the performance of HYDE in large-scale redocking and virtual screening experiments on the Astex diverse set and the DUD dataset respectively, is comparable to the best methods in this field.},

abstract = {Covalent linkage formation is a very important mechanism for many covalent drugs to work. However, partly due to the limitations of proper computational tools for covalent docking, most covalent drugs are not discovered systematically. In this article, we present a new covalent docking package, the CovalentDock, built on the top of the source code of Autodock. We developed an empirical model of free energy change estimation for covalent linkage formation, which is compatible with existing scoring functions used in docking, while handling the molecular geometry constrains of the covalent linkage with special atom types and directional grid maps. Integrated preparation scripts are also written for the automation of the whole covalent docking workflow. The result tested on existing crystal structures with covalent linkage shows that CovalentDock can reproduce the native covalent complexes with significant improved accuracy when compared with the default covalent docking method in Autodock. Experiments also suggest that CovalentDock is capable of covalent virtual screening with satisfactory enrichment performance. In addition, the investigation on the results also shows that the chirality and target selectivity along with the molecular geometry constrains are well preserved by CovalentDock, showing great capability of this method in the application for covalent drug discovery.},

abstract = {Although de novo computational enzyme design has been shown to be feasible, the field is still in its infancy: the kinetic parameters of designed enzymes are still orders of magnitude lower than those of naturally occurring ones. Nonetheless, designed enzymes can be improved by directed evolution, as recently exemplified for the designed Kemp eliminase KE07. Random mutagenesis and screening resulted in variants with >200-fold higher catalytic efficiency and provided insights about features missing in the designed enzyme. Here we describe the optimization of KE70, another designed Kemp eliminase. Amino acid substitutions predicted to improve catalysis in design calculations involving extensive backbone sampling were individually tested. Those proven beneficial were combinatorially incorporated into the originally designed KE70 along with random mutations, and the resulting libraries were screened for improved eliminase activity. Nine rounds of mutation and selection resulted in >400-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency of the original KE70 design, reflected in both higher k(cat) values and lower K(m) values, with the best variants exhibiting k(cat)/K(m) values of >5×10(4) s(-)(1) M(-1). The optimized KE70 variants were characterized structurally and biochemically, providing insights into the origins of the improvements in catalysis. Three primary contributions were identified: first, the reshaping of the active-site cavity to achieve tighter substrate binding; second, the fine-tuning of electrostatics around the catalytic His-Asp dyad; and, third, the stabilization of the active-site dyad in a conformation optimal for catalysis.},

abstract = {Fragment based drug design has emerged as an effective alternative to high throughput screening for the identification of lead compounds in drug discovery in the past fifteen years. Fragment based screening and optimization methods have achieved credible success in many drug discovery projects with one approved drug and many more compounds in clinical trials. The fragment based drug design starts with the identification of fragments or low molecular weight compounds that generally bind with weak affinity to the target of interest. The fragments that form high quality interactions are then optimized to lead compounds with high affinity and selectivity. The weak affinity of fragments for their target requires the use of biophysical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography or surface plasmon resonance to identify hits. These techniques are very sensitive and some of them provide detailed protein fragment interaction information that is important for fragment to lead optimization. Despite the huge advances in technology in the past years, experimental methods of fragment screening suffer several challenges such as low throughput, high cost of instruments and experiments, high protein and fragment concentration requirements. To address challenges posed by experimental screening approaches, computational methods were developed that play an important role in fragment library design, fragment screening and optimization of initial fragment hits. The computational approaches of fragment screening and optimization are most useful when they are used in combination with experimental approaches. The use of virtual fragment based screening in combination with experimental methods has fostered the application of fragment based drug design to important biological targets including protein-protein interactions and membrane proteins such as GPCRs. This review provides an overview of experimental and computational screening approaches used in fragment based drug discovery with an emphasis on recent successes achieved in discovering potent lead molecules using these approaches.},

By comparison, only 63 857 compounds of up to 11 atoms were found in public databases (a combination of PubChem, ChemACX, ChemSCX, NCI open database, and the Merck Index). A total of 538 of the 1208 ring systems in GDB are currently unknown in the CAS Registry and Beilstein databases in any carbon/heteroatom/multiple-bond combination or as a substructure. Over 70\% of GDB molecules are chiral. Because of their small size, all compounds obey Lipinski's bioavailability rule. A total of 13.2 million compounds also follow Congreve's "Rule of 3" for lead-likeness. A Kohonen map trained with autocorrelation descriptors organizes GDB according to compound classes and shows that leadlike compounds are most abundant in chiral regions of fused carbocycles and fused heterocycles. The projection of known compounds into this map indicates large uncharted areas of chemical space. The potential of GDB for drug discovery is illustrated by virtual screening for kinase inhibitors, G-protein coupled receptor ligands, and ion-channel modulators.

@article{Metz2001,
abstract = {Spectroscopically calibrated DFT is used to investigate the reaction coordinate of O(2) binding to Hemocyanin (Hc). A reaction path is calculated in which O(2) approaches the binuclear copper site with increasing metal-ligand overlap, which switches the coordination mode from end-on eta(1)-eta(1), to mu-eta(1):eta(2), then to butterfly, and finally to the planar [Cu(2)(mu-eta(2):eta(2)O(2))] structure. Analysis of the electronic structures during O(2) binding reveals that simultaneous two-electron transfer (ET) takes place. At early stages of O(2) binding the energy difference between the triplet and the singlet state is reduced by charge transfer (CT), which delocalizes the unpaired electrons and thus lowers the exchange stabilization onto the separated copper centers. The electron spins on the copper(II) ions are initially ferromagnetically coupled due to close to orthogonal magnetic orbital pathways through the dioxygen bridging ligand, and a change in the structure of the Cu(2)O(2) core turns on the superexchange coupling between the coppers. This favors the singlet state over the triplet state enabling intersystem crossing. Comparison with mononuclear model complexes indicates that the protein matrix holds the two copper(I) centers in close proximity, which enthalpically and entropically favors O(2) binding due to destabilization of the reduced binuclear site. This also allows regulation of the enthalpy by the change of the Cu--Cu distance in deoxyHc, which provides an explanation for the O(2) binding cooperativity in Hc. These results are compared to our earlier studies of Hemerythrin (Hr) and a common theme emerges where the spin forbiddeness of O(2) binding is overcome through delocalization of unpaired electrons onto the metal centers and the superexchange coupling of the metal centers via a ligand bridge.},

abstract = {We report a combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) study on the mechanism of reversible dioxygen binding in the active site of hemocyanin (Hc). The QM region is treated by broken-symmetry density functional theory (DFT) with spin projection corrections. The X-ray structures of deoxygenated (deoxyHc) and oxygenated (oxyHc) hemocyanin are well reproduced by QM/MM geometry optimizations. The computed relative energies strongly depend on the chosen density functional. They are consistent with the available thermodynamic data for oxygen binding in hemocyanin and in synthetic model complexes when the BH\&HLYP hybrid functional with 50\% Hartree-Fock exchange is used. According to the QM(BH\&HLYP)/MM results, the reaction proceeds stepwise with two sequential electron transfer (ET) processes in the triplet state followed by an intersystem crossing to the singlet product. The first ET step leads to a nonbridged superoxo CuB(II)-O2(•-) intermediate via a low-barrier transition state. The second ET step is even more facile and yields a side-on oxyHc complex with the characteristic Cu2O2 butterfly core, accompanied by triplet-singlet intersystem crossing. The computed barriers are very small so that the two ET processes are expected to very rapid and nearly simultaneous.},

The major structural differences between natural and combinatorial compounds originate mainly from properties introduced to make combinatorial synthesis more efficient. These include the number of chiral centers, the prevalence of aromatic rings, the introduction of complex ring systems, and the degree of the saturation of the molecule as well as the number and ratios of different heteroatoms. As drug molecules derive from both natural and synthetic sources, they cover a joint area in property space of natural and combinatorial compounds. A PCA-based scheme is presented that differentiates the three classes of compounds. It is suggested that by mimicking certain distribution properties of natural compounds, combinatorial products might be made that are substantially more diverse and have greater biological relevance.},

@article{Hoksza2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemical space is virtual space occupied by all chemically meaningful organic compounds. It is an important concept in contemporary chemoinformatics research, and its systematic exploration is vital to the discovery of either novel drugs or new tools for chemical biology.

RESULTS: In this paper, we describe Molpher, an open-source framework for the systematic exploration of chemical space. Through a process we term 'molecular morphing', Molpher produces a path of structurally-related compounds. This path is generated by the iterative application of so-called 'morphing operators' that represent simple structural changes, such as the addition or removal of an atom or a bond. Molpher incorporates an optimized parallel exploration algorithm, compound logging and a two-dimensional visualization of the exploration process. Its feature set can be easily extended by implementing additional morphing operators, chemical fingerprints, similarity measures and visualization methods. Molpher not only offers an intuitive graphical user interface, but also can be run in batch mode. This enables users to easily incorporate molecular morphing into their existing drug discovery pipelines.

CONCLUSIONS: Molpher is an open-source software framework for the design of virtual chemical libraries focused on a particular mechanistic class of compounds. These libraries, represented by a morphing path and its surroundings, provide valuable starting data for future in silico and in vitro experiments. Molpher is highly extensible and can be easily incorporated into any existing computational drug design pipeline.},

In the case of all approved therapeutic agents, the time frame has been extended to cover the 30 years from January 1, 1981, to December 31, 2010, for all diseases worldwide, and from 1950 (earliest so far identified) to December 2010 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwide. We have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a "natural product mimic" or "NM" to join the original primary divisions and have added a new designation, "natural product botanical" or "NB", to cover those botanical "defined mixtures" that have now been recognized as drug entities by the FDA and similar organizations. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the final drug entity, is still alive and well. Thus, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from around the 1940s to date, of the 175 small molecules, 131, or 74.8\%, are other than "S" (synthetic), with 85, or 48.6\%, actually being either natural products or directly derived therefrom. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked, with, as expected from prior information, the anti-infective area being dependent on natural products and their structures. Although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have been used very successfully in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are able to identify only one de novo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this 30-year time frame. We wish to draw the attention of readers to the rapidly evolving recognition that a significant number of natural product drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or microbial interactions with the "host from whence it was isolated", and therefore we consider that this area of natural product research should be expanded significantly.},

At the same time, the I7L proteinase exemplifies several interesting challenges from the rational drug design perspective. In the absence of a published I7L X-ray structure, we have built a detailed 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site (S2-S2' pocket) based on exceptionally high structural conservation of this site in proteases of the ULP family. The accuracy and limitations of this model were assessed through comparative analysis of available X-ray structures of ULPs, as well as energy based conformational modeling. The 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site was used to perform covalent docking and VLS of a comprehensive library of about 230,000 available ketone and aldehyde compounds. Out of 456 predicted ligands, 97 inhibitors of I7L proteinase activity were confirmed in biochemical assays ( approximately 20\% overall hit rate). These experimental results both validate our I7L ligand binding model and provide initial leads for rational optimization of poxvirus I7L proteinase inhibitors. Thus, fragments predicted to bind in the prime portion of the active site can be combined with fragments on non-prime side to yield compounds with improved activity and specificity.},

@article{Hoffer2013,
abstract = {This paper describes the use and validation of S4MPLE in Fragment-Based Drug Design (FBDD)--a strategy to build drug-like ligands starting from small compounds called fragments. S4MPLE is a conformational sampling tool based on a hybrid genetic algorithm that is able to simulate one (conformer enumeration) or more molecules (docking). The goal of the current paper is to show that due to the judicious design of genetic operators, S4MPLE may be used without any specific adaptation as an in silico FBDD tool. Such fragment-to-lead evolution involves either growing of one or linking of several fragment-like binder(s). The native ability to specifically "dock" a substructure that is covalently anchored to its target (here, some prepositioned fragment formally part of the binding site) enables it to act like dedicated de novo builders and differentiates it from most classical docking tools, which may only cope with non-covalent interactions. Besides, S4MPLE may address growing/linking scenarios involving protein site flexibility, and it might also suggest "growth" moves by bridging the ligand to the site via water-mediated interactions if H2O molecules are simply appended to the input files. Therefore, the only development overhead required to build a virtual fragment→ligand growing/linking strategy based on S4MPLE were two chemoinformatics programs meant to provide a minimalistic management of the linker library. The first creates a duplicate-free library by fragmenting a compound database, whereas the second builds new compounds, attaching chemically compatible linkers to the starting fragments. S4MPLE is subsequently used to probe the optimal placement of the linkers within the binding site, with initial restraints on atoms from initial fragments, followed by an optimization of all kept poses after restraint removal. Ranking is mainly based on two criteria: force-field potential energy and RMSD shifts of the original fragment moieties. This strategy was applied to several examples from the FBDD literature with good results over several monitored criteria: ability to generate the optimized ligand (or close analogs), good ranking of analogs among decoy compounds, and accurate predictions of expected binding modes of reference ligands. Simulations included "classical" covalent growing/linking, more challenging ones involving binding site conformational changes, and growth with optional recognition of putatively favorable water-mediated interactions.},

abstract = {Structure-based drug design is frequently used to accelerate the development of small-molecule therapeutics. Although substantial progress has been made in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the availability of high-resolution structures is limited owing to the frequent inability to crystallize or obtain sufficient NMR restraints for large or flexible proteins. Computational methods can be used to both predict unknown protein structures and model ligand interactions when experimental data are unavailable. This paper describes a comprehensive and detailed protocol using the Rosetta modeling suite to dock small-molecule ligands into comparative models. In the protocol presented here, we review the comparative modeling process, including sequence alignment, threading and loop building. Next, we cover docking a small-molecule ligand into the protein comparative model. In addition, we discuss criteria that can improve ligand docking into comparative models. Finally, and importantly, we present a strategy for assessing model quality. The entire protocol is presented on a single example selected solely for didactic purposes. The results are therefore not representative and do not replace benchmarks published elsewhere. We also provide an additional tutorial so that the user can gain hands-on experience in using Rosetta. The protocol should take 5-7 h, with additional time allocated for computer generation of models.},

abstract = {Accidental discoveries always played an important role in science, especially in the search for new drugs. Several examples of serendipitous findings, leading to therapeutically useful drugs, are presented and discussed. Captopril, an antihypertensive Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was the first drug that could be derived from a structural model of a protein. Dorzolamide, a Carboanhydrase inhibitor for the treatment of glaucoma, and the HIV protease inhibitors Saquinavir, Indinavir, Ritonavir, and Nelfinavir are further examples of therapeutically used drugs from structure-based design. More enzyme inhibitors, e.g. the anti-influenza drugs Zanamivir and GS 4104, are in clinical development. In the absence of a protein 3D structure, the 3D structures of certain ligands may be used for rational design. This approach is exemplified by the design of specifically acting integrin receptor antagonists. In the last years, combinatorial and computational approaches became important methods for rational drug design. SAR by NMR searches for low-affinity ligands that bind to proximal subsites of an enzyme; linkage with an appropriate tether produces nanomolar inhibitors. The de novo design program LUDI and the docking program FlexX are tools for the computer-aided design of protein ligands. Work is in progress to combine such approaches to strategies for combinatorial drug design.},

This rapidly expanding field probes fascinating questions about the uses of metal ions in nature. Respiration, metabolism, photosynthesis, gene regulation, and nerve impulse transmission are a few of the many natural processes that require metal ions, and new systems are continually being discovered. The use of unnatural metals - which have been introduced into human biology as diagnostic probes and drugs - is another active area of tremendous medical significance. This introductory text, written by two pioneering researchers, is destined to become a landmark in the field of bioinorganic chemistry through its organized unification of key topics. Accessible to undergraduates, the book provides necessary background information on coordination chemistry, biochemistry, and physical methods before delving into topics that are central to the field: What metals are chosen and how are they taken up by cells? How are the concentrations of metals controlled and utilized in cells? How do metals bind to and fold biomolecules? What principles govern electron transfer and substrate binding and activation reactions? How do proteins fine-tune the properties of metals for specific functions? For each topic discussed, fundamentals are identified and then clarified through selected examples. An extraordinarily readable writing style combines with chapter-opening principles, study problems, and beautifully rendered two-color illustrations to make this book an ideal choice for instructors, students, and researchers in the chemical, biological, and medicalcommunities.},

Previous crystal surveys have generated 1D frequency distributions of hydrogen-bond distances and angles, which are not sufficient to model the hydrogen bond as a ligand-receptor interaction. For each hydrogen-bonding group of interest to the drug designer, geometric hydrogen-bond criteria have been derived. The 3D distribution of complementary atoms about each hydrogen-bonding group has been ascertained by dividing the space about each group into bins of equal volume and counting the number of observed hydrogen-bonding contacts in each bin. Finally, the propensity of each group to form a hydrogen bond has been calculated. Together, these data can be used to predict the potential site points with which a ligand could interact and therefore could be used in molecular-similarity studies, pharmacophore query searching of databases, or de novo design algorithms.},

abstract = {A general approach for the computational design of enzymes to catalyze arbitrary reactions is a goal at the forefront of the field of protein design. Recently, computationally designed enzymes have been produced for three chemical reactions through the synthesis and screening of a large number of variants. Here, we present an iterative approach that has led to the development of the most catalytically efficient computationally designed enzyme for the Kemp elimination to date. Previously established computational techniques were used to generate an initial design, HG-1, which was catalytically inactive. Analysis of HG-1 with molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and X-ray crystallography indicated that the inactivity might be due to bound waters and high flexibility of residues within the active site. This analysis guided changes to our design procedure, moved the design deeper into the interior of the protein, and resulted in an active Kemp eliminase, HG-2. The cocrystal structure of this enzyme with a transition state analog (TSA) revealed that the TSA was bound in the active site, interacted with the intended catalytic base in a catalytically relevant manner, but was flipped relative to the design model. MD analysis of HG-2 led to an additional point mutation, HG-3, that produced a further threefold improvement in activity. This iterative approach to computational enzyme design, including detailed MD and structural analysis of both active and inactive designs, promises a more complete understanding of the underlying principles of enzymatic catalysis and furthers progress toward reliably producing active enzymes.},

Opportunity for bias arising from the use of surrogate informants affected 17 studies, followed by disease misclassification (11 studies) and selection bias (10 studies). Eleven studies explored the relationship of AD with solvents, seven with EMF, six with pesticides, six with lead and three with aluminium. For pesticides, studies of greater quality and prospective design found increased and statistically significant associations.

abstract = {Contact surface area and chemical properties of atoms are used to concurrently predict conformations of multiple amino acid side chains on a fixed protein backbone. The combination of surface complementarity and solvent-accessible surface accounts for van der Waals forces and solvation free energy. The scoring function is particularly suitable for modeling partially buried side chains. Both iterative and stochastic searching approaches are used. Our programs (Sccomp-I and Sccomp-S), with relatively fast execution times, correctly predict chi1 angles for 92-93\% of buried residues and 82-84\% for all residues, with an RMSD of approximately 1.7 A for side chain heavy atoms. We find that the differential between the atomic solvation parameters and the contact surface parameters (including those between noncomplementary atoms) is positive; i.e., most protein atoms prefer surface contact with other protein atoms rather than with the solvent. This might correspond to the driving force for maximizing packing of the protein. The influence of the crystal packing, completeness of rotamer library and precise positioning of Cbeta atoms on the accuracy of side-chain prediction are examined. The Sccomp-S and Sccomp-I programs can be accessed through the Web (http://sgedg.weizmann.ac.il/sccomp.html) and are available for several platforms.},

For the development of a new metal interaction model, we perform a statistical analysis of metal interaction geometries that are relevant to protein-ligand complexes. A total of 43,061 metal sites of the Protein Data Bank (PDB), containing amongst others magnesium, calcium, zinc, iron, manganese, copper, cadmium, cobalt, and nickel, were evaluated according to their metal coordination geometry. Based on statistical analysis, we derived a model for the automatic calculation and definition of metal interaction geometries for the purpose of molecular docking analyses. It includes the identification of the metal-coordinating ligands, the calculation of the coordination geometry and the superposition of ideal polyhedra to identify the optimal positions for free coordination sites. The new interaction model was integrated in the docking software FlexX and evaluated on a data set of 103 metalloprotein-ligand complexes, which were extracted from the PDB. In a first step, the quality of the automatic calculation of the metal coordination geometry was analyzed. In 74\% of the cases, the correct prediction of the coordination geometry could be determined on the basis of the protein structure alone. Secondly, the new metal interaction model was tested in terms of predicting protein-ligand complexes. In the majority of test cases, the new interaction model resulted in an improved docking accuracy of the top ranking placements.},

Seventy-five percent of the residues had an assignable primary conformation, and 68\% of the residues had at least one significant alternate conformation. The average correlation time for switching between rotamers ranged from 22 ps for Met to over 8 ns for Cys; this time decreased 20-fold on the surface of the protein and modestly for dihedral angles further from the main chain. Side chain S(2) axis order parameters were calculated and they correlated well with those derived from NMR relaxation experiments (R = 0.9). Relationships relating the S(2) axis order parameters to rotamer occupancy were derived. Overall the Dynameomics rotamer library offers a comprehensive depiction of side chain rotamer preferences and dynamics in solution, and more realistic distributions for dynamic proteins in solution at ambient temperature than libraries derived from crystal structures, in particular charged surface residues are better represented. Details of the rotamer library are presented here and the library itself can be downloaded at http://www.dynameomics.org.},

abstract = {Because of their wide use in molecular modeling, methods to compute molecular surfaces have received a lot of interest in recent years. However, most of the proposed algorithms compute the analytical representation of only the solvent-accessible surface. There are a few programs that compute the analytical representation of the solvent-excluded surface, but they often have problems handling singular cases of self-intersecting surfaces and tend to fail on large molecules (more than 10,000 atoms). We describe here a program called MSMS, which is shown to be fast and reliable in computing molecular surfaces. It relies on the use of the reduced surface that is briefly defined here and from which the solvent-accessible and solvent-excluded surfaces are computed. The four algorithms composing MSMS are described and their complexity is analyzed. Special attention is given to the handling of self-intersecting parts of the solvent-excluded surface called singularities. The program has been compared with Connolly's program PQMS [M.L. Connolly (1993) Journal of Molecular Graphics, Vol. 11, pp. 139-141] on a set of 709 molecules taken from the Brookhaven Data Base. MSMS was able to compute topologically correct surfaces for each molecule in the set. Moreover, the actual time spent to compute surfaces is in agreement with the theoretical complexity of the program, which is shown to be O[n log(n)] for n atoms. On a Hewlett-Packard 9000/735 workstation, MSMS takes 0.73 s to produce a triangulated solvent-excluded surface for crambin (1 crn, 46 residues, 327 atoms, 4772 triangles), 4.6 s for thermolysin (3tln, 316 residues, 2437 atoms, 26462 triangles), and 104.53 s for glutamine synthetase (2gls, 5676 residues, 43632 atoms, 476665 triangles).},

@article{Deb2002,
abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use
non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1)
their O(MN<sup>3</sup>) computational complexity (where M is the number
of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism
approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this
paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II
(Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of
the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting
approach with O(MN<sup>2</sup>) computational complexity is presented.
Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by
combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N
solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on
difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to
find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the
true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution
strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other
elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse
Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in
order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently.
Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test
problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear
problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective
optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

abstract = {Target-based drug discovery must assess many drug-like compounds for potential activity. Focusing on low-molecular-weight compounds (fragments) can dramatically reduce the chemical search space. However, approaches for determining protein-fragment interactions have limitations. Experimental assays are time-consuming, expensive, and not always applicable. At the same time, computational approaches using physics-based methods have limited accuracy. With increasing high-resolution structural data for protein-ligand complexes, there is now an opportunity for data-driven approaches to fragment binding prediction. We present FragFEATURE, a machine learning approach to predict small molecule fragments preferred by a target protein structure. We first create a knowledge base of protein structural environments annotated with the small molecule substructures they bind. These substructures have low-molecular weight and serve as a proxy for fragments. FragFEATURE then compares the structural environments within a target protein to those in the knowledge base to retrieve statistically preferred fragments. It merges information across diverse ligands with shared substructures to generate predictions. Our results demonstrate FragFEATURE's ability to rediscover fragments corresponding to the ligand bound with 74\% precision and 82\% recall on average. For many protein targets, it identifies high scoring fragments that are substructures of known inhibitors. FragFEATURE thus predicts fragments that can serve as inputs to fragment-based drug design or serve as refinement criteria for creating target-specific compound libraries for experimental or computational screening.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions of men and women worldwide. It is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons and dystrophic neurons. Several risk factors are associated with the early onset and progression of the disease. Although the initiating molecular events are not entirely known, in recent years it has become evident that environmental and/or nutritional factors may play a causal, disruptive, and/or protective role in the development of AD. While a direct causal role for aluminum or other transition metals (copper, zinc, iron) in AD has not yet been definitively demonstrated, epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated levels of these metals in the brain may be linked to the development or progression of AD. This review summarizes studies which implicate a role for several metals in contributing to or causing AD.},

@article{Reulecke2008,
abstract = {We developed a new empirical scoring function, HYDE, for the evaluation of protein-ligand complexes. HYDE estimates binding free energy based on two terms for dehydration and hydrogen bonding only. The essential feature of this scoring function is the integrated use of log P-derived atomic increments for the prediction of free dehydration energy and hydrogen bonding energy. Taking the dehydration of atoms within the interface into account shows that some atoms contribute favorably to the overall score, while others contribute unfavorably. For instance, hydrogen bond functions are penalized if they are dehydrated unless they can overcompensate this loss by forming a hydrogen bond with excellent geometry. The main stabilizing contribution represents the removal of apolar groups from the water: the hydrophobic effect. Initial studies using the DUD dataset show that with HYDE, there is a significant decrease in false positives, a reasonable categorization of compounds as either non-binders, weak, medium or strong binders, and in particular, there is a generally applicable and thermodynamically sensible cutoff score below which there is a high likelihood that the compound is indeed a binder.},

@article{Axenopoulos2014,
abstract = {Protein functions are carried out through their interactions with other biological molecules. Research in protein interactions has attracted special interest from the scientific community for decades and still remains a hot research topic. Among others, there is an increasing interest to develop computational methods that automatically predict the 3D structure of protein-protein complexes, such as protein-protein docking. In this thesis, we propose novel approaches to assist protein-protein docking and protein similarity search. The proposed methods are based on the fact that when two proteins interact, their surfaces at the binding site demonstrate geometric complementarity (apart from physicochemical complementarity). The first docking method is based on geometric complementarity matching of the molecular surfaces. The basic idea of this algorithm is to use a descriptor that measures 3D shape similarity for computing shape complementarity, since equally-sized complementary surface patches tend to have similar shapes. A basic property of the proposed shape descriptor is its invariance to rotations of the surface patches. Complementarity matching is achieved through pairwise comparison of the local shape descriptors, thus, providing a fast geometric filtering and avoiding the exhaustive translational and rotational search of existing docking techniques.The second docking method extends this work in order to produce a docking algorithm that is robust to relatively small conformational changes of the interacting proteins. Since accurate surface complementarity has been proven to be inappropriate in unbound docking, the new method allows binding of surfaces with approximate surface complementarity. Experiments proved that the improved algorithm is more robust to conformational changes. Furthermore, a new scoring function is presented, which combines geometric complementarity with physicochemical factors, such as Coulomb potentials, van der Waals forces, hydrophobicity. The scoring function takes as input the list of candidate poses and a new rank list is produced having more near-native poses in the first positions. The last method that is proposed in this dissertation is an approach for molecular shape comparison. It aims to assist the problem of virtual screening, a process that is commonly used in rational drug design. More specifically, a new shape descriptor is proposed that combines local, global and hybrid local-global shape features. It is experimentally proven that the proposed compound descriptor is appropriate for similarity search of flexible ligands, while at the same time is robust in shape comparison of rigid proteins. Due to its compactness, the new descriptor enables fast screening of similar ligands to a target molecule from very large compound databases.\%\%\%\%Ο$\iota$ $\lambda$$\epsilon$$\iota$$\tau$ο$\upsilon$$\rho$$\gamma$ί$\epsilon$ς $\tau$$\omega$$\nu$ $\pi$$\rho$$\omega$$\tau$$\epsilon$ϊ$\nu$ώ$\nu$ $\pi$$\rho$$\alpha$$\gamma$$\mu$$\alpha$$\tau$ο$\pi$ο$\iota$ού$\nu$$\tau$$\alpha$$\iota$ $\kappa$$\upsilon$$\rho$ί$\omega$ς $\mu$έ$\sigma$$\omega$ $\tau$$\omega$$\nu$ $\alpha$$\lambda$$\lambda$$\eta$$\lambda$$\epsilon$$\pi$$\iota$$\delta$$\rho$ά$\sigma$$\epsilon$ώ$\nu$ $\tau$ο$\upsilon$ς $\mu$$\epsilon$ ά$\lambda$$\lambda$$\alpha$ $\mu$ό$\rho$$\iota$$\alpha$.
